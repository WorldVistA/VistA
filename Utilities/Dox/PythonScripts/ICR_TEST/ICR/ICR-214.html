The following is entered as DBIA until the next version
of DA:

All components indentified in this integration request involve reading
from IFCAP files.  Drug Accountability does not write to any IFCAP files.
Looking toward an interface with the IFCAP Generic Inventory Package, Drug
Accountability (PSA) begins the process with a Connection Menu.  The PSAINIT
creates in the DRUG file (#50) a multiple (#50.0441) pointing to the IFCAP
ITEM MASTER file (#441), enabling a direct link between the DRUG file (#50)
and the ITEM MASTER file (#441).

The first connecting tool provided in the Connection Menu is a sub- menu
using the National Drug Code (NDC) to attempt matching entries.  In the ITEM
MASTER file (#441), the NDC field (#4) is located in the VENDOR multiple (#6).
This field has an input transform that prevents a user from using the same NDC
for more than one ITEM MASTER file entry.  In studying an ITEM MASTER file
from a local site, it was discovered that there were several entries in their
ITEM MASTER file that did possess the same NDC.  Since this situation might
lead a connector to link a drug to a potentially less active item, the first
option in the NDC Menu is the NDC Duplicates Report (ITEM file).  This report
loops through the NDC ("F") x-ref in #441.  If more than one item contains the
same NDC and is not inactive (field #16, '$G(^PRC(441,D0,3))), the duplicates
are listed.  The report displays the NDC that has more than one item attached
to it, the item numbers attached, their SHORT DESCRIPTION (#.05), and the
VENDOR (#6) =&gt; VENDOR file (#440,#1) that contains the duplicated NDC.

The second item on the NDC Menu is the Report Potential NDC Matches
option.  This report loops through the active, unlinked (to #441) entries in
the DRUG file (#50) that have an NDC.  If a corresponding NDC is found in the
"F" x-ref in the ITEM MASTER file (#441), the NDC and drug name are listed
from the DRUG file (#50) and the ITEM NUMBER (#.01) and DESCRIPTION (#.1)
listed from the ITEM MASTER file (#441).  Using the ITEM NUMBER ("AB") x-ref
in the DRUG file (#50), a check is made to see if the matched ITEM MASTER file
entry is already linked to another DRUG file entry.  If so the user is
informed of the existing connection.

Using this same loop and display criteria, the Controlled Connection by
NDC Match allows the user the opportunity to actually link matched entries.
If the user approves the displayed match, a ^DIE stuff of the item number into
the item multiple (#50.0441) in the DRUG file occurs.  Likewise, the Automated
DRUG/ITEM file link by NDC option uses the same loop and display criteria and
the ^DIE stuff for all matches in the loop.

In the event that the user requires more information about a selected drug
from either the DRUG file or the ITEM MASTER file before linking, the
Inquire/Compare DRUG file/ITEM file option is available.  This option uses a
FM inquire with a no-link pointer jump from the DRUG file to the ITEM MASTER
file via the NDC "F" x-ref in #441.  The user selects the drug from the DRUG
file and along with corresponding info from the DRUG file the DESCRIPTION
(#.1), NSN (#5), NDC (VENDOR (#6),#4) by which the jump occurred, and from
that same VENDOR multiple the UNIT COST (#1), UNIT OF PURCHASE (#1.5), DATE OF
UNIT PRICE (#2.5), PACKAGING MULTIPLE (#1.6), calculated unit cost = UNIT COST
(#1)/DISPENSE UNITS PER ORDER UNIT from the DRUG file, VENDOR (#.01), CREATED
BY (#15), and with a jump to #200 their OFFICE PHONE NUMBER.  Using this same
jump, the DRUG file/ITEM file Comparison Report displays the same data with
the user selecting a range of drugs from the DRUG file.

The FSN Menu functions similar to the NDC Menu.  The Report Potential FSN
Matches option loops through the active, unlinked (to #441) entries in the
DRUG file that have an FSN.  If a corresponding NSN is found in the "BA" x-ref
in the ITEM MASTER file, the FSN and drug name are listed from the DRUG file
and the ITEM NUMBER (#.01) and DESCRIPTION (#.1) listed from the ITEM MASTER
file.  Using the ITEM NUMBER ("AB") x-ref in the DRUG file, a check is made to
see if the matched ITEM MASTER file entry is already linked to another DRUG
file entry.  If so the user is informed of the existing connection.

Using this same loop and display criteria the Controlled Connection by
FSN Match option allows the user to actually link matched entries.  If the
user approves the displayed match, a ^DIE stuff of the item number into the
item multiple (#50.0441) in the DRUG file occurs.  Likewise, the Automated
DRUG/ITEM File Link by FSN option uses the same loop and display criteria and
the ^DIE stuff for all matches in the loop.

The Single Drug Match option uses both the NDC and FSN/NSN tools
described previously to offer a connection for a single selection from the
DRUG file.  If a link to an ITEM MASTER file entry already exists, it is
displayed to the user and they may edit the connection in the DRUG file.
Using the ITEM NUMBER multiple pointer (#50.0441) in the DRUG file, the user
can also do look-ups to the ITEM MASTER file via available x-refs (NSN (BA),
SHORT DESCRIPTION (C), VENDOR STOCK # (D), or NDC (F)) in order to select
additional connections.

The Report of Unlinked DRUG/ITEM File Entries lists active drugs from the
DRUG file which do not yet have any entries in the ITEM NUMBER multiple
(#50.0441).  The Connect Unlinked DRUG/ITEM file Entries option loops through
these unlinked entries and offers all the tools described in the Single Drug
Match option to perform the links.

The Active, Unlinked Drugs in the ITEM File option allows the user to
select a purchase date from which to consider an ITEM MASTER file drug active.
It then loops through the ITEM MASTER file and when an entry's FSC (#2) = 6505
(Federal Supply Classification for drugs), is not an INACTIVATED ITEM? (#16),
is not linked to a drug('$O(^PSDRUG,"AB",ITEM,"")), has an entry in the FCP
(#1) multiple, and has within at least one FCP entry, an entry in the PURCHASE
ORDER (#1) multiple, the P.O. DATE(s) (#442,#.1) are checked against the user
selected purchase date.  For entries that pass this criteria, the ITEM NUMBER
(#.01), SHORT DESCRIPTION (#.05), NSN (#5), LAST VENDOR ORDERED (#9), NDC
(#6,#4) (for the LAST VENDOR ORDERED), and the DESCRIPTION (#.1) are
displayed.

The Display Connected Drug option allows the user to print both a vendor
catalog for a selected item as well as a procurement history.  The user
selects an entry from the DRUG file.  If it is connected to more than one
entry in the ITEM MASTER file the user is asked to select one of the connected
entries from the ITEM NUMBER multiple (#50.0441).  From the ITEM MASTER file,
the ITEM NUMBER (#.01), SHORT DESCRIPTION (#.05),and NSN are displayed. If the
selected ITEM MASTER file entry has only one VENDOR (#6) or has a MANDATORY
SOURCE (#10), then that vendor is displayed along with the VENDOR STOCK #
(#3), NDC (#4), PACKAGING MULTIPLE (#1.6), UNIT OF PURCHASE (#1.5), UNIT COST
(#1), MINIMUM ORDER (#8), DATE OF UNIT PRICE (#2.5), and REQUIRED ORDER
MULTIPLE (#9).  If there is more than one vendor for the item, the LAST VENDOR
ORDERED (#9) is displayed as well as each available vendor sorted by DATE OF
UNIT PRICE (#2.5), beginning with the most recent date.  For each vendor the
PACKAGING MULTIPLE (#1.6), UNIT OF PURCHASE (#1.5), UNIT COST (#1), DATE OF
UNIT PRICE(#2.5), and whether or not the vendor has a current contract is
listed.  The contract verification is made by looping through the CONTRACT
NUMBER multiple (#6) in the VENDOR file (#440) and checking the EXPIRATION
DATE (#1).  If there is an entry in the FCP (#1) multiple for the selected
item and any of the FCP entries have an entry in their PURCHASE ORDER (#1)
multiple, the user is offered a procurement history.  They can enter a date
from which they wish to view the history.  They must also select an FCP.  For
each purchase order that passes the criteria, the PURCHASE ORDER NUMBER
(#.01), VENDOR (#5), P.O. DATE (#.1), QUANTITY (#40,#2) (LINE ITEM NUMBER
located using the "AE" x-ref in the ITEM (#40) multiple), UNIT OF PURCHASE
(#3), TOTAL COST(#15), and QUANTITY PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED (#11) are displayed.
Average ordered/month, total ordered, and total cost are also listed.
If the MANDATORY SOURCE (#10) for the selected item is flagged in the
VENDOR file (#440) with an "S" in the SUPPLY WHSE. INDICATOR (#.05), then the
user is informed that the Supply Warehouse is the mandatory source.  Using the
"AD" x-ref in the INVENTORY TRANSACTION file (#445.2) a check is made for any
distribution by the warehouse of this item.  If procurement history exists,
the user is informed and allowed to enter a date from which to view the
history.  By looping through the "AD" x-ref in #445.2 and checking the
TRANSACTION ID (#1)?1"R".N and the DATE POSTED (#2.5) is not less than the
user entered date, a history is displayed.  From the INVENTORY TRANSACTION
file (#445.2), the DATE POSTED (#2.5), TRANSACTION/P.O. NUMBER (#410),
-QUANTITY (#6), PACKAGING UNIT (#5), SELLING UNIT PRICE (#8), and OTHER
INVENTORY POINT AFFECTED (#14) are displayed.

The Unposted Procurement History and Posted Drug Procurement History
options are an effort to restore some of the drug accountability lost with the
disappearance of the LOG 036 report.  For the Unposted Procurement History,
the user is asked to select a month to review.  A loop through the PROCUREMENT
&amp; ACCOUNTING TRANSACTION file (#442), using the P.O. DATE ("AB") x-ref
collects PO's for the user selected month.  If the COST CENTER (#2) = 822400
(Pharmacy) and the SUPPLY STATUS (#.5)&gt;14 &amp; &lt;45 (basically ordered), the PO's
are sorted into ^TMP by Station/FCP.  For each Station/FCP the PO's are
listed, displaying PURCHASE ORDER NUMBER (#.01), P.O. DATE (#.1), FCP(#1),
VENDOR (#5), and TOTAL AMOUNT (#91).  While looping through these PO's another
^TMP is created, sorted by the DESCRIPTION (#1) of each ITEM (#40) on each PO.
The user is asked if they would like to print item totals.  If so, an
alphabetical listing occurs displaying each ITEM's (#40) DESCRIPTION (#1) and
REPETITIVE (PR CARD) NO. (#1.5) and each PURCHASE ORDER NUMBER (#.01), P.O.
DATE (#.1), FCP (#1), QUANTITY (#40,#2), ACTUAL UNIT COST (#40,#5), and TOTAL
COST (#40,#15).  Finally, the user is if they would like a list of high dollar
items.  They are invited to enter a cut-off dollar amount and each item
exceeding that amount is listed beginning with the highest total cost.  The
total cost was determined by totaling the TOTAL COST (#40,#15) amounts for
each item listed in the previous display and building a ^TMP to sort from high
to low.  Each ITEM's (#40) DESCRIPTION (#1), total TOTAL COST (#15), and
Station/FCP is shown.

The Posted Drug Procurement History option uses the TYPE OF INVENTORY
POINT ("AC") x-ref in the GENERIC INVENTORY file (#445) to locate a "W" or the
warehouse inventory.  A loop through the INVENTORY ITEM (#1) multiple, using
the ITEM NO. (#.01) to check in the ITEM MASTER (#441) file for a FSC (#2) =
6505 (Federal Supply Classification for drugs) isolates the warehouse drugs in
^TMP.  Looping through ^TMP a check is made using the INVENTORY POINT ("AD")
x-ref in the INVENTORY TRANSACTION (#445.2) file to isolate items that have
had distribution (TRANSACTION ID (#1)?"R".N) and fall within the user selected
month (DATE POSTED (#2.5)).  These transactions are sorted by the OTHER
INVENTORY POINT AFFECTED (#14) and the OTHER INVENTORY POINT AFFECTED (#14) ,
-QUANTITY (#6), QUANTITY (#410,#10,#2) obtained by using the TRANSACTION /P.O.
NUMBER (#445.2,#410), PACKAGING UNIT (#5), SELLING UNIT PRICE (#8), total cost
(-QUANTITY (#6) * SELLING UNIT PRICE (#8)), DATE POSTED (#2.5), and
TRANSACTION/P.O. NUMBER (#410).  Similar to the Unposted Procurement History,
a high dollar sort is also offered.

As stated in the opening paragraph, the Connection Menu lays the
groundwork for an interface with the IFCAP Generic Inventory Package.  Phase
two of this process is contained in a Pharmacy Location Menu.  With this menu
the Pharmacy user will create and edit the parameters of a Drug Accountability
location such as Inpatient, Outpatient, or a Combined (IP/OP) operation.  The
purpose of the interface is to allow the receiving that occurs in the
Inventory Package to pass the converted dispensing unit quantity of a
connected drug (ITEM/DRUG file) from a Generic Inventory point (#445) to a
Drug Accountability location (#58.8).  To establish a direct link between
these two files, a PRIMARY INVENTORY POINT field exists in the DRUG
ACCOUNTABILITY STATS file (#58.8).  This field points to the GENERIC INVENTORY
file (#445) uses the TYPE OF INVENTORY POINT (#.7) = "P" and COST CENTER (#.9)
= 822400 (Pharmacy) fields as screens.  The input transform also contains a
call to ^PSAUTL where the "E" x-ref in #58.8 is checked to prevent the linking
of one primary inventory point to more than one DA location.  The Set up/edit
a Pharmacy Location option allows the user to edit this link.  If a DA
location (#58.8)is linked to an Inventory point (#445), the INVENTORY ITEMS
(#1) are checked both against the "AB" x-ref in the DRUG (#50) file and the
"C" x-ref in the DA (#58.8) file to see if all Inventory items are tracked in
DA.  If not the user is given the ability (^DIE) to add Inventory items to the
DA location.  The Display Location option shows the PRIMARY INVENTORY POINT
(#11) currently linked to the selected DA location.

The Inventory Interface sub-menu contains three report options and a
populate option.  The Report of Inventory items' link to DRUG file displays
from a selected GENERIC INVENTORY point (#445), selection screened by COST
CENTER (#.9) = 822400 and TYPE OF INVENTORY POINT (#.7) = "P", the ITEM NO.
(#445,#1,#.01), either the DESCRIPTION (#.7) or from the ITEM MASTER file
(#441), the SHORT DESCRIPTION (#.05)and if connected the DRUG (#50) name.  The
Loadable Inventory Items Report operates exactly the same, however, only lists
connected items.  The Populate Pharmacy Location with Inventory items option
uses the same criteria and if a connected drug within an inventory point does
not yet exist in the DRUG (#10) multiple in the selected DA location (#58.8),
a ^DIE stuff occurs with a list of drugs loaded displayed at a user selected
device.  The Display Drugs Not Loaded in Primary option loops through the DRUG
(#10) multiple in a selected DA location (#58.8) and using the "AB" x-ref in
the DRUG (#50) file, checks the "AE" x-ref in the GENERIC INVENTORY (#445)
file for the existance of each drug in the linked Primary Inventory Point.
Those drugs not found in the Inventory point are displayed along with their
ITEM MASTER (#441) file NUMBER (#.01) and SHORT DESCRIPTION (#.05).
