Description:
============

 Important Note: In production, there is one **MANDATORY**
 pre-installation activity associated with this install.
  
 The Integrated Billing (IB) Staff MUST empty the 837 extract/transmission 
 queue PRIOR to the installation of this patch.
  
 Please reference instructions from the Pre/Post Installation Overview for 
 further details.
  
 Integrated Billing (IB) is a software module within Veterans Health
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) that provides
 the ability for billing personnel to submit claims in either a paper or
 electronic format to third-party payers.
  
 The following features of the IB software will be affected by this 
 patch:
  
    * Cloning a Primary Claim
  
      The option Copy and Cancel [IB COPY AND CANCEL], cancels the bill
      associated with the bill number entered by the user.  It also
      creates a new bill, with a new bill number.  If the original bill
      is a primary claim (destination payer is the primary payer) and it
      has one or more associated Medicare-equivalent Remittance Advice
      (MRA) or Explanation of Benefits (EOB), then the new primary claim
      will now copy the COB data from the MRA/EOB to the new primary
      claim correctly.
  
    * Field Length Adjustments
  
      The IB VistA package has the ability to send proprietary
      professional and institutional medical claims to Financial Services
      Center(FSC).  These claims contain data that is used by FSC to
      create transactions that comply with the X12N/005010X222 Health
      Care Claim (837) and X12N/005010X223 Health Care Claim (837)
      standards.  Where possible, the IB software has been modified so
      that claim data can be transmitted in updated data element sizes,
      in the proprietary claim messages sent to FSC, that are compliant
      with the latest version of the 837 standards.  The IB software has
      also been modified to allow the entry of longer data.  This change
      ensures that the third party payers receive and process claims and
      distribute payments to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
      without any issues caused because VistA could not capture or store
      data elements as long as those allowed by the standards.
  
    * Unit or Basis for Measurements Codes for Drugs
  
      Previously, when creating professional and institutional bills for
      submission to payers, the system automatically defaulted to Unit as
      the type of measurement and users were unable to choose another
      type of measurement.  Users were prompted to enter only the
      quantity of units. 
  
      The billing staff needed to be able to submit the correct type of
      units or basis for measurement codes and a quantity of units for
      medications provided during appointments.  These units or basis for
      measurement codes are specific to the National Drug Code associated
      with the medication.
  
      The system has been updated to allow for different types of
      measurement (qualifiers) to be available to users.  Users can enter
      ?? to display the available selections for a Unit or Basis for
      Measurement code. The default value for unit or basis of
      measurement continues to be Unit.  
  
      The following units or basis for measurement codes have been made
      available from which billing staff can select:
         o  F2  - International Unit
         o  GR - Gram
         o  ME - Milligram
         o  ML - Milliliter
         o  UN - Unit
  
    * Print NDC Number on UB04
  
      The IB VistA package has been modified to print the type of unit or
      basis for measurement on Form Locator 43 on a locally printed UB04
      claim form.  This is in addition to the printing of a non-
      prescription National Drug Code (NDC) number and the quantity of
      the medication delivered that previously printed on the UB04 claim
      form.
  
    * Process Payer ID - Store HCCH Payer ID
  
      The Integrated Billing (IB) VistA package has been modified so
      that for when there is no Professional or Institutional Payer ID
      defined in VistA and a claim (or claims) is transmitted to the
      payer(s) and the Health Care Clearing House (HCCH) has an
      electronic agreement with the payer(s), the HCCH is to do a lookup
      of the Payer IDs and return them to VistA in a 277STAT transaction.
      The VistA software now uses the Payer IDs in the 277STAT message
      to update the Payer IDs for the corresponding companies in the
      Insurance Company file (#36) when those fields are blank.
  
      The system now processes a 277STAT message from Health Care
      Clearing House (HCCH) and evaluates/updates Payer IDs as follows:
         o  Update the Insurance file, field EDI ID NUMBER - PROF
            [#36,3.02] or EDI ID NUMBER - INST [#36,3.04] with the Payer
            IDs from the 277STAT transaction only when the value that is
            on file is blank.  When these fields are updated new data
            elements to capture changes are also updated along with the
            date of update for reporting purposes.
         o  If the Payer ID from the 277STAT transaction is different
            than what is stored and it is not blank, then no update
            occurs, but the data is stored with the new data elements
            including the date for reporting purposes only.
  
      Also the intermittent issue of updating EDI ID numbers when there
      is no value stored, has been resolved. 
  
    * Payer ID Report
  
      A new report has been created which, based on a specified period
      of time, identifies what Insurance Company payers identification
      numbers (EDI ID NUMBER - PROF [#36,3.02] or EDI ID NUMBER - INST
      [#36,3.04] the system has either changed or attempted to change
      as a result of a 277STAT message received from the Health Care
      Clearing House (HCCH).

 *  associated with this install.                                        *
 *                                                                       *

 *************************************************************************
     
 INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO EMPTY THE 837 EXTRACT TRANSMISSION QUEUE:
 ===============================================================
 The site Information Resource Management (IRM) MUST coordinate with the
 Billing Department to insure that the 837 extract/transmission queue is
 empty. Once the Billing Department has completed the instructions, the 
 Billing department is to inform IRM that the patch installation may 
 proceed.
    
 The instructions to empty the queue are as follows:
 Select the option: TRANSMIT EDI BILLS - MANUAL [IBCE 837 MANUAL TRANSMIT]
     
   What is the purpose of this option?
    This option is used to by-pass the normal daily/nightly transmission
    queues if the need arises to get the claim to the payer quickly.
     
   When is this option used?
    There are occasions when there is a need to transmit a claim(s)
    immediately instead of waiting for the batching frequency as scheduled
    in the MCCR Site Parameter.  This option will allow sending individual
    claim(s) or all claims in a ready for extract status.
      
   Upon selecting this option you will be prompted with the following:
     Select one of the following:
      A  Transmit (A)LL bills in READY FOR EXTRACT status
      S  Transmit only (S)ELECTED bills
     
   You should select 'A' for ALL
      
 There are no other mandatory pre-installation activities associated with
 this patch.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
 The Pre-install routine (IBY577PR) will automatically do the following:
  *     Update entries used by the Forms Output Utility [IBCE OUTPUT 
        FORMATTER].
  *     Add a new entry in IB ERROR file (#350.8).
    
 The Post-install (IBY577PO) will automatically do the following:
  *     Recompile the Billing Screen Input Templates
  *     Survey the Form Type file (#353) to identify which form numbers
        are being used at the site.  Then an email will be attempted to
        be sent to the MCCF EDI TAS Development Team with this information
        which will be used to determine which form numbers are available
        for future development.
     
 Routines IBY577PO and IBY577PR may be manually deleted by IT/IRM upon
 completion of the installation.
  
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 2 
 minutes to install.
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options:
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  To Install the Patch, from the Installation Menu, select the Install
     Package(s) option and choose the patch to install. When prompted for
     the INSTALL NAME, enter the patch # (ex. XXX*X.X*XX)
  
 5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? NO//'  You may press return to accept the default answer of 
     NO IF your system rebuilds menu trees nightly using TaskMan. If you 
     do not have this scheduled as a nightly task, you must answer YES to 
     rebuild the menu trees.  This could affect users on the system 
     and your installation time will increase.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//, enter 'NO'
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO//, enter 'NO'
