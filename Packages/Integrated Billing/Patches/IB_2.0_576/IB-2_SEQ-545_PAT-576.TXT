Description:
============

 ****Important Note: In production, there is one **MANDATORY**
 pre-installation activity associated with this install.
  
 The IB Staff MUST empty the 837 extract/transmission queue
 PRIOR to the installation of this patch. ***
  
 The site Information Resource Management (IRM) should coordinate with the
 Billing Department to insure that the 837 extract/transmission queue is
 empty. Once the Billing Department has completed the instructions, the 
 Billing department is to inform IRM that the patch installation may 
 proceed.
  
 The instructions to empty the queue are as follows:
  
 Select the option:   TRANSMIT EDI BILLS - MANUAL [IBCE 837 MANUAL 
 TRANSMIT]
  
  
   What is the purpose of this option?
    This option is used to by-pass the normal daily/nightly transmission
    queues if the need arises to get the claim to the payer quickly.
  
   When is this option used?
    There are occasions when there is a need to transmit a claim(s)
    immediately instead of waiting for the batching frequency as scheduled
    in the MCCR Site Parameter.  This option will allow sending individual
    claim(s) or all claims in a ready for extract status.
  
   Upon selecting this option you will be prompted with the following:
     Select one of the following:
      A  Transmit (A)LL bills in READY FOR EXTRACT status
      S  Transmit only (S)ELECTED bills
  
   You should select 'A' for ALL
  
 There are no other mandatory pre-installation activities associated
 with this patch.
  
 IB is a software module within Veterans Health Information Systems and
 Technology Architecture (VistA) that provides the ability for billing
 personnel to submit claims in either a paper or electronic format to
 third-party payers.
  
 The following features of the IB software will be affected by this 
 patch:
  
    * eBilling Set Onset Date Appropriately
  
      When completing professional health care claims, the eBilling system 
      automatically defaulted the date of service as the onset date when
      there is no Occurrence code with the correct date the current illness
      or symptom first appeared.  There should only be a date if there is
      an Occurrence code for onset of illness or Last Menstrual Period
      (LMP).  The system should not automatically default the onset date to
      the date of service. 
  
      In support of this logic, the following fatal error message will be
      changed:
      
      **Errors**:
      Occ. codes for accident, LMP, illness not allowed on same bill
  
      The new fatal error message will no longer include accident.  
      Accident Occurrence codes are now printed in Box 15.  The new message
      will be the following:
  
      **Errors**
      Occ. codes Onset of Illness (11) and LMP (10) not allowed on same
      bill.
  
    * Missing MRW Legend Indicator
  
      When viewing claim responses on the MRA Management WorkList [IBCE MRA
      MANAGEMENT], staff needs the ability to see indicators that reflect
      the current status of the entry on the list in order to assist them
      with their workload.  There are currently several indicators that
      appear in front and behind bill numbers, but not all are found on the
      legend.  Staff needs the ability to also see the indicator for review
      in process on the legend.  
  
      This should be displayed in the legend as follows:
  
      *=review in process 
  
    * Printing of CMS 1500
  
      When printing CMS 1500 claim forms locally, billing staff must be
      able to print the bill frequency code and the original claim
      reference number, Internal Claim Number (ICN)/Document Control Number
      (DCN), for replacement of prior claims or void/cancel prior claims in
      the correct field locator (FL). The bill frequency code and ICN
      number do not currently print on the CMS 1500 form for replacement or
      voided/canceled claims.
  
      By printing the following bill frequency codes and the original claim
      reference number (ICN/DCN) on professional replacement claims for 
      non-Medicare payers (note: Medicare claims cannot be printed locally)
      in FL 22, payers are able to determine the correct status of the
      claim and process it accordingly and in a timely manner.
  
      Bill Frequency Code           Description
      7                             Replacement of prior claim
      8                             Void/Cancel of prior Claim
  
    * Correct an issue on Screen 10 for CMS-1500s
  
      A problem was found on Screen 10 while testing CMS-1500s.  It had to 
      do with the proper display of the "TERTIARY INSURANCE ICN/DCN" prompt
      which was displayed as "FORM LOCATOR 64C".
  
    * Payer Zip Code Field Adjustment 
  
      Users can currently enter a five or nine-digit zip code in the
      following payer address fields in the INSURANCE COMPANY (#36) file:
         
        * Main Mailing Address - ZIP CODE (#.116) field
        * Inpatient Claims Office Address - CLAIMS (INPT) PROCESS ZIP 
          (#.126) field
        * Appeals Address - APPEALS ADDRESS ZIP (#.146) field
        * Inquiry Address - INQUIRY ADDRESS ZIP CODE (#.156) field
        * Outpatient Claims Office Address - CLAIMS (OPT) PROCESS ZIP 
          (#.166) field
        * Prescription Claims Office Address - CLAIMS (RX) ZIP (#.186)
          field
  
      The fields are set up to accept the standard nine digit code, and
      users should be required to enter the maximum standard number of
      digits.  VistA IB should require users to enter a properly formatted
      and valid ZIP code that is nine digits long when entering a new ZIP
      code or editing an existing ZIP code.
  
      The process required to accomplish this functionality is outlined
      below:
  
        * VistA IB verifies that the ZIP code is a 9 character numeric  
          value.  
        * VistA IB verifies the last 4 digits are not 0000 or 9999. 
        * VistA does not make a 5 digit payer ZIP code a fatal error in 
          billing.
        * Payer address ZIP codes that exist at the time the software 
          updates are installed will not be changed.
