Description:
============

 Integrated Billing (IB) is a software module within Veterans Health
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) that provides
 the ability for billing personnel to submit claims in either a paper or
 electronic format to third-party payers.
  
 The following features of the IB software will be affected by this 
 patch:
  
    * Transmitting SNF Claims with Appropriate Revenue Codes
  
      The IB VistA package has been modified to send Revenue Code 0022
      and VA specific AAA00 RUG/Health Insurance Prospective Payment 
      System (HIPPS) Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) rate codes for
      Medicare Primary Institutional Part A claims with bill types 21x,
      22x or 23x. Due to this modification, the System will no longer use
      the Financial Service Center (FSC) workaround.  Instead, the System
      now has the ability to perform the identical checks that FSC used to
      ensure that these SNF claims are sent. The System automatically
      allows for this in the transmission of the flat file so that the
      biller does not have to enter anything additional to have this
      information transmitted.  In addition, the VistA flat file for
      Institutional 837s has been updated and the "View/Print EDI Bill
      Extract Data" [IBCE EDI VIEW/PRINT EXTRACT] (VPE) option screens
      depict the change in the flat file for the end user to view in the
      INS segment.
  
    * Add 'T' for Transmitted to RCB Screen
  
      The IB VistA package has been modified to be enable the user to see
      "** T = Test Claim" (to explain what the "T" indicator represents)
      in the legend of the "View/Resubmit Claims - Live or Test" [IBCE
      PREV TRANSMITTED CLAIMS] (RCB) option screen when viewing previously
      Printed claims.
  
    * Remove Ability to Define Insurance Company as non-EDI
  
      The IB VistA package has been modified so the "Insurance Company
      Entry/Edit" [IBCN INSURANCE CO EDIT] (EI) option no longer provides
      the user the ability to select "0 - NO" as an option for "EDI -
      Transmit?" prompt under the EDI Parameters section of the screen.
      In addition, a one-time report from each site showing the value of
      the field to determine whether an Insurance Company is active for
      Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) will be sent to the eBiz Rapid
      Response group.
  
    * RCB Screen - Match COB Data to Payer Sequence
  
      The IB VistA package has been modified to be enable the user to
      resubmit, to the Test queue, a claim using the "View/Resubmit Claims
      - Live or Test" [IBCE PREV TRANSMITTED CLAIMS] (RCB) option and have
      only the Coordination of Benefits (COB) data that is correct for the
      payer sequence be included in the transaction.
      If a user selects:
         o  a Primary claim to resubmit and the claim has received an
            EOB/MRA from the primary payer, VistA will not send the COB
            data from the EOB/MRA and the amount billed will not be offset
            by previous payments from the primary payer.
         o  a Secondary claim to resubmit and the claim has received an
            EOB/MRA from the secondary payer, VistA will not send the COB
            data from the EOB/MRA and the amount billed will not be offset
            by previous payments from the secondary payer.
         o  a Tertiary claim to resubmit and the claim has received an
            EOB/MRA from the tertiary payer, VistA will not send the COB
            data from the EOB/MRA and the amount billed will not be offset
            by previous payments from the tertiary payer.
      If a user attempts to resubmit a claim(s) with EOB data in VistA to
      the Production queue, the system will filter out the claim(s) and
      not transmit it.  These non-transmitted claims will be listed on the
      screen as "Skipped".
  
    * Non-MCCF Unbilled Amounts Report
  
      The IB VistA package has been modified so the "Re-Generate
      Unbilled Amounts Report" [IBT RE-GEN UNBILLED REPORT] option now
      allows the user to select the following additional search criteria:
           (M)CCF, (N)on-MCCF (Outpatient Only), or (B)oth claims
      Non-MCCF Rate Types include: CHAMPVA, CHAMPVA Reimb. Ins., TRICARE,
      TRICARE Reimb. Ins., Interagency, Sharing Agreement and Ineligible.
      Non-MCCF Appointment Types include: Employee and Sharing Agreement.
      Non-MCCF Eligibility of Encounters include: CHAMPVA, TRICARE,
      Employee, Ineligible and Sharing Agreement.
  
    * Non-MCCF Pay-To Address Rate Types
  
      The IB VistA package has been modified to allow the user to be able
      to define one or more Rate Types for which the non-MCCF Pay-to
      Address (formerly the TRICARE Pay-to Address) will be used on claims
      with one of those Rate Types.  In addition, the following items are
      capable:
         o  An authorized user with access to the IB Site Parameters and
            the TRICARE Pay-to security key will be able to add/delete
            a Rate Type for which claims with that Rate Type will use the
            non-MCCF Pay-to Address data.
         o  The System will use the non-MCCF Pay-to Address data on claims
            with specified Rate Types only when the non-MCCF Pay-to
            Address is not exactly the same as the Billing Provider Name
            and Address.
         o  The System will transmit the TRICARE Pay-to Address data on
            claims with specified Rate Types in the 837-I, 837-P or 837-D
            when the non-MCCF Pay-to Address is not exactly the same as
            the Billing Provider Name and Address.
         o  The System will print the non-MCCF Pay-to Address data on
            Institutional claims with specified Rate Types on the UB04
            form (FL2) when the TRICARE Pay-to Address is not exactly
            the same as the Billing Provider Name and Address.
         o  The System will print the non-MCCF Pay-to Address data on
            Professional claims with specified Rate Types on the CMS
            1500 form (Box 33) when the non-MCCF Pay-to Address is not
            exactly the same as the Billing Provider Name and Address.
  
    * Remove Fatal Error - Rendering Provider CMS 1500
  
      The IB VistA package has been modified so that the previously fatal
      error that prevented a biller from submitting a Professional Claim
      with no Rendering Provider has been removed and instead now a
      non-fatal warning message appears to the user when a Professional
      Claim does not contain a Rendering Provider.
  
  
    * CMN Oxygen and EPN Nutrition
  
      The IB VistA package has been modified to enable the "Enter/Edit
      Billing Information" [IB EDIT BILLING INFO] option to enter the
      required data for an Oxygen Certificate of Medical Necessity (CMN)
      (CMS-484.3) or an Enteral and Parenteral Nutrition CMN (CMS-10126)
      when completing a professional bill for Durable Medical Equipment
      (DME). In addition, the ability to transmit Professional claims has
      been modified to include the CMN data in the proprietary 837-P
      Transaction to the Financial Services Center (FSC).

 *                          IMPORTANT NOTE                               *
 *  In PRODUCTION, there is one **MANDATORY** pre-installation activity  *
 *  associated with this install.                                        *
 *                                                                       *
 *  The IB Staff MUST empty the 837 extract/transmission queue PRIOR to  *
 *  the installation of this patch.                                      *
 *************************************************************************
     
 INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO EMPTY THE 837 EXTRACT TRANSMISSION QUEUE:
 ===============================================================
 The site Information Resource Management (IRM) MUST coordinate with the
 Billing Department to ensure that the 837 extract/transmission queue is
 empty. Once the Billing Department has completed the instructions, the 
 Billing department is to inform IRM that the patch installation may 
 proceed.
    
 The instructions to empty the queue are as follows:
 Select the option: TRANSMIT EDI BILLS - MANUAL [IBCE 837 MANUAL TRANSMIT]
     
   What is the purpose of this option?
    This option is used to by-pass the normal daily/nightly transmission
    queues if the need arises to get the claim to the payer quickly.
     
   When is this option used?
    There are occasions when there is a need to transmit a claim(s)
    immediately instead of waiting for the batching frequency as scheduled
    in the MCCR Site Parameter.  This option will allow sending individual
    claim(s) or all claims in a ready for extract status.
      
   Upon selecting this option, you will be prompted with the following:
     Select one of the following:
      A  Transmit (A)LL bills in READY FOR EXTRACT status
      S  Transmit only (S)ELECTED bills
     
   You should select 'A' for ALL
      
 There are no other mandatory pre-installation activities associated with
 this patch.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
 The Pre-install routine (IBY608PR) will automatically do the following:
  *     Add/Update entries used by the Forms Output Utility [IBCE OUTPUT 
        FORMATTER].
  *     Add new entries in IB ERROR file (#350.8).
    
 The Post-install routine (IBY608PO) will automatically generate the one-
 time Insurance Company EDI Parameter Report and send an email to the
 eBiz Rapid Response Group ("VHAeBillingRR@domain.ext").  This report will
 list all of the insurance companies that have the current setting for
 the Transmit Electronically parameter set to ZERO which equals 'NO'.
  
 In addition, the Post-install routine will automatically add 50 CPT
 codes to the new CMN CPT CODE INCLUSION IB Site Parameter.  This list of
 codes is a basis of those CPT codes to be referenced in processing
 claims which contain CMN Oxygen EPN Nutrition data.  This list of CPT
 codes can be maintained when accessing the IB Site Parameters.
  
 Routines IBY608PO and IBY608PR may be manually deleted by IT/IRM upon
 completion of the installation.
