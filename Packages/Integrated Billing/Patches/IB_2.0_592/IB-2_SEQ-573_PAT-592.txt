Description:
============

 Important Note: In production, there is one **MANDATORY**
 pre-installation activity associated with this install.
  
 The Integrated Billing (IB) Staff MUST empty the 837 extract/transmission 
 queue PRIOR to the installation of this patch.
  
 Please reference instructions from the Pre/Post Installation Overview for 
 further details.
  
 IB is a software module within Veterans Health
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) that provides
 the ability for billing personnel to submit claims in either a paper or
 electronic format to third-party payers.
  
 The following features of the IB software will be affected by this 
 patch:
  
  
    * Dental Claims
      
      The IB package currently has the ability to send proprietary
      professional and institutional medical claims to the Financial 
      Services Center (FSC).  These claims contain data that is used by FSC
      to create compliant X12N/005010X222 Health Care Claim (837P) and
      X12N/005010X223 Health Care Claim (837I) transactions.  This patch
      enhances the IB package to create proprietary 837 dental claims with
      the data necessary to send FSC a transaction it can map to a
      X12N/005010X224 Health Care Claim (837D) when a user authorizes a
      dental claim.  Dental claims will only be Transmitted electronically
      and cannot be printed at this time.  This enhancement touched all
      aspects of the claims billing process.
  
  
    * Two minor prior defects were also addressed as part of this patch.
  
      The first occurred when a claim was on both the CSA - Claims Status 
      Awaiting Resolution [IBCE CLAIMS STATUS AWAITING] and the CBW - COB 
      Management Worklist [IBCE COB MANAGEMENT] worklists.  If a biller
      tried to address on the CSA first, an error message would display and
      the user session would unexpectedly end.
  
      The second error occurred when a user selected Print MRA from the CBW
      but entered "^" instead of selecting a claim.  The option abruptly
      ended and has been changed to instead gracefully exit.

 *                          IMPORTANT NOTE                               *
 *  In PRODUCTION, there is one **MANDATORY** pre-installation activity  *
 *  associated with this install.                                        *
 *                                                                       *
 *  The IB Staff MUST empty the 837 extract/transmission queue PRIOR to  *
 *  the installation of this patch.                                      *
 *************************************************************************
     
 INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO EMPTY THE 837 EXTRACT TRANSMISSION QUEUE:
 ===============================================================
 The site Information Resource Management (IRM) MUST coordinate with the
 Billing Department to ensure that the 837 extract/transmission queue is
 empty. Once the Billing Department has completed the instructions, the 
 Billing department is to inform IRM that the patch installation may 
 proceed.
    
 The instructions to empty the queue are as follows:
 Select the option: TRANSMIT EDI BILLS - MANUAL [IBCE 837 MANUAL TRANSMIT]
     
   What is the purpose of this option?
    This option is used to by-pass the normal daily/nightly transmission
    queues if the need arises to get the claim to the payer quickly.
     
   When is this option used?
    There are occasions when there is a need to transmit a claim(s)
    immediately instead of waiting for the batching frequency as scheduled
    in the MCCR Site Parameter.  This option will allow sending individual
    claim(s) or all claims in a ready for extract status.
      
   Upon selecting this option, you will be prompted with the following:
     Select one of the following:
      A  Transmit (A)LL bills in READY FOR EXTRACT status
      S  Transmit only (S)ELECTED bills
     
   You should select 'A' for ALL
      
 There are no other mandatory pre-installation activities associated with
 this patch.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
 The Pre-install routine (IBY592PR) will automatically do the following:
  *     Update entries used by the Forms Output Utility [IBCE OUTPUT 
        FORMATTER].
  *     Archive BILL FORM TYPE file (#353) Internal Entry Number (IEN) 7 so
        as not to impact the new dental form.  The BILL FORM TYPE file is a
        national file, but was found to include some entries at 3 VAMCs
        which need to be safely moved to another IEN (207).
  
 The Post-install routine (IBY592PO) will automatically do the following:
  *     Add new entries to IB ERROR (#350.8) file
  *     Add new entries to TYPE OF SERVICE (#353.2) file
  *     Add new entry to IB ATTACHMENT REPORT TYPE (#353.3) file 
  *     Recompile the Input Templates for the billing screens
  *     Set default processing of dental claims to YES - IB SITE
        PARAMETERS (#350.9) File, DENTAL ENABLED? (#8.2) Field.
     
 Routines IBY592PO and IBY592PR may be manually deleted by upon completion
 of the installation.
  
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system however it is 
 highly recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  
  
 **NOTE TO INSTALLER**
 Line 2 of routine IBCU7 incorrectly lists the patch release order as:

 ,592,604,616**   
  
 when it should be:
  
 **62,52,106,125,51,137,210,245,228,260,348,371,432,447,488,461,516,522,577
 ,604,616,592**   
  
 This has NO IMPACT on functionality and will be corrected in IB*2.0*608.
