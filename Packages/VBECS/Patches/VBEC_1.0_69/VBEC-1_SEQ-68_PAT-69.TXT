Subject: APRIL 2014 WINDOWS UPDATES FOR VBECS

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This patch serves to alert VA facilities using the Vista Blood 
 Establishment Computer Software (VBECS) that Microsoft Windows Updates 
 are available for immediate installation.
  
 If the VBECS servers are serviced by a second group, i.e. a Regional 
 Data Center, it is the responsibility of the local IRM support person for 
 VBECS to ensure that all parties who need to see this Update 
 Information for 'their' VBECS system sees it. The local support should 
 follow local policies to forward such information to their Server 
 Administrators. 
  
 Sites who have not installed VBECS have no action to take with this 
 informational patch.
  
 This patch is released with a seven (7) day compliance because the 
 updates address security vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. Failure to 
 comply with the installation of Windows Updates could expose the VBECS 
 servers and software to security threats. 
  
  
 BLOOD BANK CLEARANCE 
 ===================== 
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch VBEC*1.0*69 contains 
 changes to a package referenced in BBM Team Review of VISTA Patches.
 This patch does not alter or modify any VistA Blood Bank software design 
 safeguards or safety critical elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch VBEC*1.0*69 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
  
 Windows Updates 
 ================ 
 If your servers are maintained at a data center, ignore this section 
 since data center personnel will install updates.
  
 These Microsoft Windows Update patches must be installed on the VBECS 
 servers: 
  
 KB2922229
 KB2936068
 KB890830*
  
 *Note: Windows Update KB890830 is a malicious software removal tool and 
 does not appear in the list of applied patches after installation.
  
  
 The VBECS development team must test every Microsoft Windows update. Once 
 the development team is satisfied that the update causes no adverse 
 effects, Clinical Product Support (CPS) will give the sites permission to 
 apply the update by releasing this informational patch. 
  
 Updates are approved with Windows Server Update Service. Approved updates 
 will be downloaded to your servers automatically. However, a server 
 administrator must install the updates locally.
  
 Windows Update instructions:
 ============================
  
 1) Since most updates require a reboot, coordinate a time with the Blood 
 Bank manager to apply the updates. All Blood Bank users must be logged 
 off the VBECS server before updates can begin. 
  
 2) At the agreed upon down time, log on to the VBECS cluster as a user 
 with server administrator privileges. 
  
 3) Use the Cluster Administrator Tool to verify which node is active 
    (Windows Updates should not be installed on an active node):
  
    a. Click on START, CONTROL PANEL, ADMINISTRATIVE TOOLS, CLUSTER
       ADMINISTRATOR. 
    b. If the OPEN CONNECTION TO CLUSTER window appears, enter the 
       VBECS cluster name and click OK. 
    c. When Cluster Administrator has opened click on the folder titled 
       "Groups". 
    d. The server name listed on the right side under the Owner column 
       is the "Active" node.
    e. Record the server name listed under Owner, this is the active 
       node. The other server in the VBECS cluster is the passive node.
    f. Log off of the VBECS cluster server once the server name of the 
       active node is determined. 
  
 4) Log on to the passive node of the VBECS cluster as a user with 
    server administrator privileges. 
  
 5) Verify all users (other than the user installing the Windows updates) 
    are off the VBECS server (do not proceed until all users are logged 
    off):
  
    a. Open Task Manager: click on START, RUN; Type TASKMGR and click OK.
    b. Select the USERS tab to see the users who are logged on to the 
       server.
    c. Right click on each user's name and click on SEND MESSAGE to send 
       a message to the user asking them to log off the system. 
    d. Wait for all users to logoff. If a user's status is Disconnected,
       right click the user's name and click on LOG OFF.
    e. Close TASK MANAGER after all users are logged off the server. 
  
 6) A yellow shield shaped icon should appear in the System Tray (lower 
    right corner of desktop) indicating updates are available for
    installation. 
  
 7) If the yellow shield shaped icon fails to appear after waiting one 
    minute, perform the following steps: 
  
    a. Click on START, RUN. 
    b. Type WUAUCLT.EXE /DETECTNOW and click OK. 
    c. The yellow shield shaped icon can take up to 30 minutes to appear 
       after entering the WUAUCLT.EXE /DETECTNOW command. 
    d. If the icon does not appear after 30 minutes, click on START,
       ADMINISTRATIVE TOOLS, SERVICES.   
    e. Right-click the service named "Automatic Updates" and select 
       RESTART.
    f. If the yellow shield icon does not appear within 5 minutes,
       contact the VA Service Desk (VASD) or file a Remedy ticket.
  
 8) Click on the yellow shield shaped icon in the System Tray. 
  
 9) Leave Express Install selected. Click INSTALL. 
  
 10) When the update process is complete, you may be prompted to reboot. 
    Reboot the server at this time. 
  
 11) After the reboot is completed (this may take several minutes), log 
    on to the passive node that is now fully patched. Open the Cluster 
    Administrator tool and perform these steps in order: 
  
    a. Expand the Groups folder. 
    b. Right click the VBECS Group TEST and select TAKE OFFLINE.
    c. Right click the VBECS Group PROD and select TAKE OFFLINE.
    d. Right click the Group 1 and select TAKE OFFLINE.
    e. Right click the Group 0 and select TAKE OFFLINE.
    f. Right click on the Cluster Group and select MOVE GROUP - wait 
       until the group is ONLINE before proceeding to the next step 
       (this may take up to 5 minutes).
    g. Right click on each remaining groups and select MOVE GROUP 
       (VBECS Group TEST, VBECS Group PROD, Group 1, and Group 0).
    h. Right click on Group 0 and select BRING ONLINE - wait until the 
       group is ONLINE before proceeding to the next step 
       (this may take up to 5 minutes).
    i. Right click on Group 1 and select BRING ONLINE.
    j. Right click on VBECS Group PROD and select BRING ONLINE.
    k. Right click on VBECS Group TEST and select BRING ONLINE.
    l. Examine the Resources folder. All resources should be owned by the 
       server that has just been patched (making it the active node).
    m. Close Cluster Administrator.
  
 12) Log off the patched server which is now the active node.
  
 13) Log on to the unpatched server and repeat steps 5-10.
  
 14) At this point, if the Server Windows Update process is complete and 
    there are no outstanding issues, notify the Blood Bank Manager that 
    the VBECS system is once again available for use. If any issues are 
    encountered, contact the VA Service Desk (VASD) or file a Remedy 
    ticket.
