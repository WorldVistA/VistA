# docs: Code-specific documentation goes here

Also add documentation for configuration management and deployment of your code, including:

- Build and deploy instructions, including names of any branches that get deployed automatically
- Deployment environments, both production and any test or preproduction environments
- Information on automated tests, and where to find results 
  - CI/CD hosts and configuration (including special branch names, etc)
  - Automated test coverage
- Instructions for how to set up local development

Document this here in the `README.md`, or in individual markdown files in the `docs` folder.
