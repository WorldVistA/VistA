<h1 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Women&#39;s Health 
 Potentially Unsafe Medications or Exposures (Teratogens)</h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The current version of the VHA&#39;s Veterans Health 
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) and CPRS software 
 does not provide any information to the provider that an item is teratogenic. 
 Teratogens are drugs (including medications), chemicals, or other exposures, 
 like radiation, that can interfere with normal embryonic/fetal development 
 and thus, may lead to birth defects or pregnancy loss. In addition, there 
 is a group of medications that pose a potential risk to breastfed infants.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The requested enhancements include the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; margin-top: 0px; 
			 margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 24px;">Ability to document 
	 a patient’s pregnancy status, intentions related to becoming pregnant 
	 (including methods of contraception), and breastfeeding status through 
	 both the Cover Sheet tab (using a new Women’s Health pane) and two 
	 new clinical reminder dialogs (Pregnancy/Intentions/Contraception 
	 and Update Lactation Status).</p></li>
	<li><p class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; margin-left: 24px; 
			 margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Enhanced medication 
	 and radiology order checks that consider the patient’s pregnancy status 
	 (including likelihood of becoming pregnant) and the patient’s breastfeeding 
	 status.</p></li>
	<li><p class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; margin-left: 24px; 
			 margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">A new notification to 
	 the ordering provider of high-risk medications or radiology orders 
	 when a patient’s status changes to pregnant and/or changes to lactating.</p></li>
	<li><p class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; margin-left: 24px; 
			 margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">A new notification to 
	 the Women’s Health coordinator, the ordering provider, and the maternity 
	 care coordinator when a laboratory test for pregnancy is resulted 
	 or an ICD code is added to the patient’s chart indicating a pregnancy 
	 status or breastfeeding status that differs from what is documented. 
	 When processed, the notification will prompt the user to update the 
	 documented status if appropriate.</p></li>
	<li><p class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; margin-left: 24px; 
			 margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">A new VistA notification 
	 to the Women’s Health and Maternity Care coordinators when a note 
	 associated with a documented pregnancy status or documented lactation 
	 status is deleted, retracted, or reassigned. When processed, the notification 
	 prompts the user to review the documented status and perform a chart 
	 review to ensure that the status is still accurate.</p></li>
	<li><p class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; margin-left: 24px; 
			 margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">A new report (Women’s 
	 Health: Potentially Unsafe Medications, located in the Clinical Reports 
	 -&gt; Pharmacy tree of reports) that lists the high-risk medications 
	 (both teratogenic and those that could harm breastfed infants) for 
	 female patients.</p></li>
</ul>
