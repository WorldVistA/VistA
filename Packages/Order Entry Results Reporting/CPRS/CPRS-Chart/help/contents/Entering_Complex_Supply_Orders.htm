<title>Entering Complex Supply Orders</title>

<body>
<h1 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt; color: #3366ff;">Entering 
 Complex Supply Orders</h1>
<p>Ordering supplies has changed a little in CPRS. Previously, supplies 
 were included in the Medication Order dialog. This was not an ideal situation 
 because those who might only be tasked with ordering supplies might inadvertently 
 select a medication. In addition, nurses and clerk might also have to 
 have additional permissions to order supplies that would allow them to 
 order medications as well.</p>
<p><b>To place complex supply orders, use the following steps:</b></p>
<ol>
	<li>On the Order tab under the Write Orders pane, select Supplies.</li>
	<li>In the Supplies order dialog, select the item from the list (you 
	 can type part of its name in the text box to move to that part of 
	 the list and then select the item).</li>
	<li>After selecting the item, select the Complex tab.</li>
	<li>Enter a Dosage by selecting on from the drop-down list or typing 
	 an appropriate dosage into the field</li>
	<li>Enter a Schedule using the drop-down list or by typing one in the 
	 Schedule field.</li>
	<li>Enter a Duration and the unit of time (such as days, hours, weeks, 
	 etc.).</li>
	<li>Select a conjunction (and or then) unless this is the last line.</li>
	<li>Repeat steps 4-7 until you have the entire complex order entered.</li>
	<li>(Optional) Type a Comment if needed.</li>
	<li>Enter a Days Supply.</li>
	<li>Enter a Quantity.</li>
	<li>Enter the number of Refills, if any.</li>
	<li>Select how the patient will receive the supply items (Clinic, Mail, 
	 or Window).</li>
	<li>Select a Priority from the drop-down list.</li>
	<li>Review the SIG to make sure it is correct.</li>
	<li>Make any corrections as needed.</li>
	<li>When the order is ready, select Accept Order.</li>
	<li>If the Order Check window displays, review all order checks and 
	 act appropriately.</li>
	<li>When finished, you can enter a new supply order or select Quit 
	 to exit the dialog.</li>
</ol>
