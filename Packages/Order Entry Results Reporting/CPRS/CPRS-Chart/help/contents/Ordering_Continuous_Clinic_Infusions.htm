  <h1>Ordering Continuous Clinic Infusions</h1>
  <p>Continuous infusion orders run at a specified rate. As the user selects a solution and/or additive, the items from that list are displayed to the right under Solution/Additive. For continuous infusion orders the only optional fields are the Comments and the Duration or Total Volume fields. The schedule field is not available.</p>
  <p>The Additive Frequency field enables users to select which IV bag the additive should be placed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 Bag/Day: The additive should be put in one bag for 24 hours, normally the first bag.</li>
    <li>All Bags: The additive should be placed in all bags given to the patient.</li>
    <li>See Comments: The provider wants something other than the above options and will put appropriate instructions in the Comments box.</li>
    <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
      <p style="margin-left: 48px; text-indent: -48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>   If the user selects “See Comments” for the Additive Frequency but does not enter appropriate instructions in the Comments box, Pharmacy may interpret that as All Bags.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>To order continuous Clinic Infusions, use these steps:</b></p>
  <p><img alt="This screen shot shows the Clinic Infusion Order dialog. It has numerous fields. On the upper left of the dialog are two tabs: Solutions and Additives. As the user chooses items from the lists on these two tabs, the items display on the right in a table. The table shows the name of the item as well as the Volume/Strength. The Additive Frequency field enables providers to enter which IV bag the additive the additive should be placed in: one per day, all bags, or some other instuctions the provider puts in the comments. Some of the items may be editable while others may not. Below the table with the grid is a Comments field that is optional. Other required fields include the Route (such as epidural, intravenous, and IV piggyback), the Type (Continous or Intermittent), Infusion Rate in milliliters per hour, Priority (ASAP, Routine, STAT). Next is the optional Duration or Total Volume field. Finally, the SIG field is below that and contains the order text that is created as the user selects the items in the dialog." border="0" src="assets/images/Clinic_Infuse_order_dialog.gif" style="border: none;" />The Infusion Order dialog for continuous infusion orders does not use a schedule, but it does have an infusion rate. For continuous infusion orders, the new Additive Frequency field enables providers to indicate into which IV bag the additive should be placed.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Select the <b>Orders</b> tab.</li>
    <li>From the Write Orders pane, select <b>Clinic Infusions</b>.
      <p style="margin-left: 48px; text-indent: -48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>   Depending on how menus are set up at your particular site, you may need to select a different option from the Write Orders pane. Many sites have customized the items in the Write Orders pane. Check with your CAC (or the person who manages information resources at your site) if you have trouble locating the Clinic Infusions item.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 48px; text-indent: -48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>   The following prompts will be slightly different based on the patient’s location. You will be asked to verify that you want to write Clinic Infusions and to ensure that the encounter location is a clinic location.</p>
    </li>
    <li>If prompted, enter the appropriate clinic for the encounter information. This will generally happen with an outpatient that does not yet have an encounter defined.
      <p>You can use an existing appointment if one exists or create a new one. To use Clinic Infusions, you must enter a location that was previously defined clinic. If you chose a clinic location, you will see this dialog.</p>
      <p><img alt="This show the dialog asking the user to confirm that they want to order clinic infusions." border="0" src="assets/images/Clinic_Infuse_confirm.gif" style="border: none;" /></p>
      <p>This dialog is to ensure that the user knows they are about to enter Clinic Infusions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>To continue ordering Clinic Medications, select Yes and continue to the next step. To stop the Clinic Medications process, choose No.</li>

    </li>
    <li>Select the needed solutions from the Solutions tab.</li>
    <li>Select an additive from the list (if necessary) and edit the strength if needed. Repeat for additional additives if necessary. How users can edit the strength field will depend on the values for strength defined in the pharmacy files as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>If a single strength is defined, users cannot edit the field.</li>
        <li>If multiple values for strength are defined in the pharmacy files, the field will have a drop-down list from which users can choose a strength.</li>
        <li>If no values have been defined, users can type in a strength. If a strength includes a decimal point, the value must begin with a number: so, .5 is not valid, but 0.5 is.</li>
      </ul>
       
      <p>The solution and additives you select will appear in the Solution/Additive grid.</p>

    <li>In the Type field, select <b>Continuous</b>.
      <p style="margin-left: 48px; text-indent: -48px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>   If you change the IV Type from Continuous to Intermittent, the Schedule field becomes available and the Infusion Rate field becomes the Infusion over Time field.</p>
