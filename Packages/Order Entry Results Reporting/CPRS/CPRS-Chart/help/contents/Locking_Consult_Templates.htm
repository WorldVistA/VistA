<h1 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;">Locking 
 Consult Templates</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Austin FSC Healthcare Claims Processing (HCP) 
 Referral &amp; Authorization System (RAS) requested an enhancement to 
 make a TIU template used on a consult request as read-only. This action 
 makes the template and all its associated template fields unavailable 
 for editâ€”they can be viewed in the editors, but no values may be changed. 
 RAS depends on specific text elements appearing in certain consult templates. 
 If these templates are modified by a site, the messaging between RAS and 
 VistA Consults/Request Tracking can be disrupted.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In Consults, a MailMan error message is generated 
 when there is a communication issue between RAS and VistA. This message 
 has been improved to include the HCPS support mail group as a recipient. 
 In addition, the message body will now include the consult number and 
 facility name from where the consult originated. These new elements will 
 assist HCPS support with more rapid resolution of communication errors.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">These templates should not be edited by facilities 
 and as such will be locked during the installation of CPRS GUI v31b.</p>
