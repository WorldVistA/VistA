It has boilerplate and cut-and-paste capabilities. It is closely tied to Authorization/Subscription Utility (ASU) which includes User Class definitions and Business Rules. These tools allow sites to set up a system that defines who is qualified to do what to which kinds of documents. ASU is expected to be enhanced so that it can replace security keys. it will let a facility control most roles and responsibilities at a hospital as far as ordering, signing, editing, etc. through business rules and user class definition.</font>
