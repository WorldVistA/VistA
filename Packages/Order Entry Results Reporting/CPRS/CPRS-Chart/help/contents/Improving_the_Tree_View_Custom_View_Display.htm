  <h1>Improving the Tree View Custom View Display</h1>
  <p>CPRS enables users to set a maximum number of notes that should display when the Notes tab loads. The purpose of defining a maximum number of notes is to avoid loading a large amount of information that might slow performance. When there is a value in the Max Number to Return field, CPRS has some additional features on the tree view: a “Show More” item and another display category called “Older signed notes with recent addenda”.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Show More</strong> </p>
  <p>If the user has more notes available than the maximum allowed, a “Show More” entry displays in the tree view. If the user double clicks “Show More”, CPRS downloads another set of notes as the initial maximum.  If there are still more notes available, “Show More” appears again until there are no more notes to display.</p>
  <p><br />
    For example, if the selected patient has 300 total notes and the Maximum Number of Notes is set to 30, when the Notes tab<a data-xref="{title}" href="Improving_the_Tree_View_Custom_View_Display.htm">Improving the Tree View Custom View Display</a> initially opens, 30 Notes will be downloaded, and their information displayed in the tree view. A Show More item will display at the end of the tree view because there are more notes. If the user selects Show More, another 30 notes will be downloaded and listed, so 60 items now show in the tree view. If the user selects Show More again, another 30 notes and the Show More item will display. This will continue until all the notes have been listed. </p>

     </p>
  <p><strong>Older signed notes with recent addenda</strong> </p>
  <p>Sometimes one or more notes outside the maximum range will have an addendum inside the range. These notes are added to the bottom of the list, under the date of the parent note.  In this example, the last two notes have recent addenda but are well outside the range of the rest of the notes.  This makes it appear that there are no notes between the last normal note (dated April 2019) and the older parent note with the recent addendum (dated March 2009).</p>

    <figcaption>This shows the notes with addenda as they previously display. </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p> </p>
  <p>To prevent the appearance of a gap in notes, these older notes are now separated from the rest of the notes after the “Show More” entry, marked with the label “Older signed notes with recent addenda”.</p>
  <figure><img alt="This screen capture shows the progress notes tree view with the Older signed notes with recent addenda section. This should make it clearer the date for notes and addenda." src="assets/images/Addenda_from_older_Progress_notes_new_display_2021_04_01.gif" />
