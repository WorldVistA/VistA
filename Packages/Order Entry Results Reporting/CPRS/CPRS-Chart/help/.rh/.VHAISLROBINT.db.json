As the name implies, you cannot enter, or update the information connected with any patient. The purpose of CPRS Read-Only is to give controlled access to specific users that will enable them to review the medical records but not change any information.\nUsers will be able to open the patient charts made available to them, including accessing remote data from other VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) facilities and from the Department of Defense if available. Read-Only users can view, copy, and print reports that are available from the Reports tab of CPRS.\nEach site controls who has CPRS Read-Only access. To grant a user CPRS Read-Only access, someone at the site (probably whoever creates new users) will make entries into the NEW PERSON file to give the user access only to the Reports tab and usually assign a restricted patient list that contains the appropriate records. If the list is not assigned when you try to run the application, CPRS Read-Only will show an error message that states \"Patient selection list not found.\" When the user click OK to close the message box, CPRS Read-Only aborts.\n \nRelated Topics\nAvailable Reports on the Reports Tab\nViewing a Health Summary\nViewing a Report\nPrinting a Report (Table View)\nSorting a Report (Table View)\n\n\n","Path::contents/Accessibility_Changing_the_Font_Sizes.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Accessibility_Changing_the_Font_Sizes.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Accessibility_Changing_the_Font_Sizes.htm#LLILZV","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Accessibility_Changing_the_Font_Sizes.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Accessibility_Changing_the_Font_Sizes.htm"},{"origLink":"Accessibility_Changing_the_Font_Sizes.htm#BQF3N2P","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Accessibility_Changing_the_Font_Sizes.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Accessibility_Changing_the_Font_Sizes.htm"},{"origLink":"Accessibility_Changing_the_Font_Sizes.htm#BQF3N2P","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Accessibility_Changing_the_Font_Sizes.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Accessibility_Changing_the_Font_Sizes.htm"},{"origLink":"Keyboard_Shortcuts_for_Common_CPRS_Commands.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Accessibility_Changing_the_Font_Sizes.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Keyboard_Shortcuts_for_Common_CPRS_Commands.htm"},{"origLink":"Accesibility_Changing_the_Window_Color.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Accessibility_Changing_the_Font_Sizes.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Accesibility_Changing_the_Window_Color.htm"}],"Path::contents/Accessibility_Changing_the_Font_Sizes.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Accessibility_Changing_the_Font_Sizes.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Accessibility_Changing_the_Font_Sizes.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Accessibility_Changing_the_Font_Sizes.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Accessibility_Changing_the_Font_Sizes.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Accessibility_Changing_the_Font_Sizes.htm::Bookmarks":[{"id":"LLILZV","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"LLILZV"},{"id":"BQF3N2P","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"BQF3N2P"}],"Path::contents/Accessibility_Changing_the_Font_Sizes.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Accessibility_Changing_the_Font_Sizes.htm::Title":"Accessibility: Changing the Font Sizes","Path::contents/Accessibility_Changing_the_Font_Sizes.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Font size,Windows:font size","Path::contents/Accessibility_Changing_the_Font_Sizes.htm::InnerText":"\nChanging the Font Size\nCPRS supports 8, 10, 12, 14, and 18 point font sizes.

If the user requires font sizes larger than 18 point, then the use of font magnification software, such as Windows Magnifier or other similar tools is recommended.\nChanging the size of the fonts used in CPRS is a two-step process.

If you change the font size, some screen components will be resized to fit the new font size. If this occurs, you will need to manually resize some dialog boxes and screen components.

now uses Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine—Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) for documenting problems on the patient’s problem list.\nNote:      Remember that the diagnosis on the Encounter form can be added to the Problems tab by simply selecting the checkbox to put it there.\n \nWith the Lexicon search, the initial search contains frequently used problems within the VA and new problems are added each Lexicon Quarterly release. The Extended Search represents a larger subset of SNOMED CT containing all the terms from the Clinical Findings, Events, and Situation with Explicit Context hierarchies. Currently, all terms are linked to a placeholder ICD-10-CM code of R69 and may be updated through the Encounter Form workflow.\nTo speed up documentation in Problem List and to avoid the dual entry in the Encounter Form application, enhancements were completed to enable the use of the VA-National Problem Selection List or a VISN, or local problem selection list. Sites can use the National Problem Selection List that has curated Problem Categories with problems represented in SNOMED CT that are linked to ICD-10-CM code(s). In addition, sites can create Local Problem Selection Lists. Users or clinics who want to create their own Local Problem Selection List will need to request this from a Clinical Application Coordinator (CAC) and will be responsible for maintaining these Local lists. \nIt is highly recommended that sites use the National Problem Selection List because it will be nationally maintained.  The National Problem Selection List will display by default unless the user or clinic already has a Problem Selection List defined. The Problem Selection List is displayed in the left pane of the Add a New Problem dialog.\n \nTo add a new problem to a patient’s problem list, use these steps:\n1.     Select the Problems tab.\n2.     Select New Problem\n-or-\nselect Action | New Problem....\nThe Problem List Lexicon Search dialog displays.\nNote:       If encounter information has not been entered, the encounter information dialog will appear before the Problem List Lexicon Search dialog. You must enter an encounter location and provider before proceeding.\n\nIf sites have not assigned a different problem selection list to a user or clinic, the VA-National Problem List Selection list will display as shown above. The top pane shows the problem categories. Selecting a category will display the problems in that category in the pane below.\n \n3.     If the user is set up to use the National Problem Selection List the National Problem Categories with the associated problem are displayed based on the category. If the problem is not found within the category, skip to step 4 by selecting Other Problem to bring up the Problem List Lexicon Search dialog.\n\nThe Problem List Lexicon Search dialog enables users to search for the term that best describes the patient’s problem. SNOMED codes are used to define the problems..\n \n4.      Enter part or all of a term that describes the problem in the Enter Term to Search field and press <Enter> or select Search.\nCPRS will search the lexicon for problems that contain the search term. The matching problems will appear in the bottom portion of the Problem List Lexicon Search dialog. The search now looks for SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). There is also a parameter to hide the codes if sites so choose.\n\nIn this search, some items have additional items grouped under them. The user can expand items with an arrow next to them to see additional items.\n5.     Select the appropriate term if it is in the list. If you do not see the appropriate problem listed, select the Extend Search button.\nOn the Problems tab, the Extend Search button extends the search to a larger subset of SNOMED CT.\n\nWhen the search is extended by the user, more matching results are returned that are linked to the ICD-10-CM R69. If the user still does not find the desired term, the user may choose to enter a free text entry by selecting the Freetext Problem button.\n \n6.      If the user does not find the desired term using the Extend Search they may choose to enter a free text entry, the user may choose to do the following actions.\n\n \nTo refine your search, select No and return to step 4. To use this term, select Yes and go to step 7.\n \no     Terms Found But Not Adequate: If the extended search displays terms, but not the one you want, you will need to decide whether to enter a free-text term or revise your search.\nTo begin the search again using another term, return to step 4 and use another term to identify the problem.\nTo enter a free-text term, select the Freetext Term button. The Unresolved Entry dialog will display as shown below:\n\nThis dialog shows when the system does not find any terms that match the text entered by the provider or when the provider selects the Freetext button because an adequate term is not displayed. From the Unresolved Entry dialog, the provider can choose to use the term as entered, and if needed, request that it be added as a new term.\nTo use this term, you first need to decide if you want to request that the term you entered be added as a new term. To request a new term, you need to check the Request New Term check box and add a comment if needed. If not, leave the check box unchecked. Then, to add this term to the Problem List as entered, select Yes and go to step 8.\nNote:      If you request a new term, a bulletin is sent to a local group for review. This group will then forward the request if it concurs that a new term is needed.\n \no     No Terms Found: If the extended search finds no terms, the Unresolved Entry dialog will display as shown below. To try another search, select No and return to step 4.\n \nNote: If you try to select a problem that has an inactive diagnosis or procedure code, you will be prompted to select a problem with an active code. If you select a term that is not mapped to a specific ICD-9-CM code (one with a 799.9 designation--Other unknown and unspecified cause of morbidity or mortality), a dialog will warn the user that the term is not mapped, tell the user that the term will be reviewed and will not be available for selection on the Encounter form, and then ask if the user wants to use that term or cancel their selection. If the user chooses to use the term, a bulletin will be sent to the Standards and Terminology Services team to consider mapping the term to a specific term.\n \nThe New Problem form will appear.\n \n7. Complete the New Problem form by following the steps below:\na) Select a status for the problem (Active or Inactive).\nb) Choose an immediacy for the problem (Active, Chronic, or unknown).\nc) Enter the date of onset.\nd) Select a responsible provider from the drop-down list.\ne) Choose clinic from the drop-down list.\nf) Check any applicable treatment factors that apply to this problem.\ng) Enter any comments (if necessary) by pressing the Add comment button. You can also edit a comment or remove the comment using the appropriate buttons.\n \n8. Select OK.\n \nRelated Topics\nProblems List\nAnnotating a Problem\nChanging a Problem\nCustomizing the Problems

Only documents created after \n the installation of these patches will have copied and pasted text tracked.\nExcessive copying and pasting has at least these \n impacts on healthcare:\n\n\tunnecessary \n\t duplication of information\n\tlengthening \n\t of notes and making chart reading more difficult\n\tslowing \n\t the retrieval of notes by the workstation\n\timproving \n\t accuracy of the note and the patient information\n\n \nTo help sites better audit what text is copied and \n pasted into clinical documents, CPRS defines\n\n\twho \n\t can view pasted text\n\twhat \n\t constitutes tracked pasted text\n\thow \n\t CPRS will display pasted text\n\thow \n\t the auditor can view the pasted text\n\thow the person auditing can turn on or \n\t off the display of pasted text \n\n \nWho Can View Pasted Text?\nAfter signature, only individuals assigned to specific \n user classes will be able to view text that has been copied and pasted. \n With CPRS v31b, users in these User Classes are assigned to be able to \n audit copying and pasting by default:\n\n\tCHIEF, MIS\n\tCHIEF, HIMS\n\tPRIVACY ACT OFFICER\n\nIn addition, sites can give other user classes the \n ability to view copy/paste data.\n \nWhat \n Constitutes Tracked Paste?\nIf a user pastes text into a clinical document within \n CPRS, CPRS will track that as a paste if it meets several criteria. When \n a user copies information within VistA or CPRS, CPRS will store characteristics \n about the copied text if it is available, such as the title and author \n of the document it came from, or whatever information it can about the \n source. The information gathered when text is copied can then be displayed \n if the text is pasted.\nIf text is copied from outside of CPRS or it is altered \n after being pasted into CPRS, the source information may simply read “Outside \n of current CPRS tracking”, meaning that CPRS does not know where it came \n from.\n \nCharacter Limits for Pasted \n Text\nA 20,000 character limit is hard-coded. If a paste \n exceeds 20,000 characters, CPRS will not try to track the source. It will \n still show on the report and the percentage will be calculated as discussed \n below. The text will still be tracked, but it will not be able to track \n the source.\n \nOther Copy/Paste \n Characteristics that Sites Can Set\nThere are several criteria that determine whether \n a copy and paste will be tracked or displayed with identifying marks in \n CPRS. Sites have some control over how these criteria are set. The criteria \n are as follows:\n\n\tMinimum Number of Words: \n\t To be considered a paste, there must be at least the specified number \n\t of words. For example, if it is set at 15 words and a user pastes \n\t 14, CPRS will not identify it as a paste. The default is 5 words.\n\tPercentage Check: Because \n\t providers often edit text after it is pasted, CPRS checks what percentage \n\t of the original paste is in the document. For example, if this percentage \n\t is set at 85 percent and the user pastes some text but then edits \n\t it so that only 75 percent of the original text remains, it will not \n\t display as pasted text. The default is 90% unless changed by your \n\t site.\n\tRole: Until a note is signed, \n\t the author and cosigner can see highlighted pasted text. After the \n\t note is signed, only users in specified user classes will see the \n\t pasted text.\n\tExclude Note Title: Site \n\t can specify notes that will not be tracked for copy/paste.\n\tExclude Application: Sites \n\t can specify that specified applications are not tracked for copy/paste. \n\t One application (natspeak.exe) is already included in this parameter.\n\nClinical Application Coordinators (CACs) set the \n values for these parameters.\n \nWhen Text Will Not Display \n as Pasted\nIn addition to these parameters, certain actions \n will determine whether pasted text displays in CPRS with its identifiers.\n\n\tAfter Signature: While the \n\t author of a note is writing the note or editing it, CPRS will identify \n\t pasted text with highlighting or other methods as set by the user, \n\t if it meets the criteria above. If the author or cosigner of the document \n\t signs the document and they are not in the designated user class that \n\t can view pasted text, the pasted text will no longer be identified \n\t for them as pasted. In other words, if it is highlighted, it will \n\t no longer be highlighted and the area showing the pastes will not \n\t display it. The pastes can still be identified to auditors in CPRS.\n\tWithin the Same Note: When \n\t text is copied and pasted from within the same note.\n\tLines with 2 words or less: Lines \n\t with only 2 words or less do not highlight even though they are tracked.\n\nRelated topics\nProgress Notes\nSetting \n How Pasted Text Will Display to Auditors, Authors, and Cosigners\n \n\n\n","Path::contents/Canceling_Out_of_the_Processing_Dialog.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Canceling_Out_of_the_Processing_Dialog.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Processing_a_Reminder.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Canceling_Out_of_the_Processing_Dialog.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Processing_a_Reminder.htm"},{"origLink":"Moving_to_Another_Reminder.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Canceling_Out_of_the_Processing_Dialog.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Moving_to_Another_Reminder.htm"},{"origLink":"Finishing_Reminder_Processing.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Canceling_Out_of_the_Processing_Dialog.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Finishing_Reminder_Processing.htm"},{"origLink":"Clearing_a_Single_Reminder.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Canceling_Out_of_the_Processing_Dialog.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Clearing_a_Single_Reminder.htm"}],"Path::contents/Canceling_Out_of_the_Processing_Dialog.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Canceling_Out_of_the_Processing_Dialog.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Canceling_Out_of_the_Processing_Dialog.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Canceling_Out_of_the_Processing_Dialog.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Canceling_Out_of_the_Processing_Dialog.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Canceling_Out_of_the_Processing_Dialog.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Canceling_Out_of_the_Processing_Dialog.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Canceling_Out_of_the_Processing_Dialog.htm::Title":"Canceling Out of the Processing Dialog","Path::contents/Canceling_Out_of_the_Processing_Dialog.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Cancel,Cancel:reminder,Clinical Reminders,Reminders,Reminders:cancel","Path::contents/Canceling_Out_of_the_Processing_Dialog.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Canceling Out of the Processing Dialog\n  \n  \n    If you reach the Reminders processing dialog by mistake or if you have entered information for reminders, but you need to get rid of that information and start over, simply click Cancel.\n  \n  \n    Note:      \n    If you click Cancel,\n    you will lose all of the information for reminders that you have entered\n    .

As with many types of orders, the user can create personal quick orders for blood com\n    ponents and tests the user frequently orders.\n  \n  \n    On this dialog, the user specifies:\n  \n  \n    ·      \n    Blood Components\n    –\n    The list of items comes from CPRS from a parameter and shows what blood products can be offered. Items might include:\n  \n  \n    o   Red blood cells\n  \n  \n    o   Fresh frozen plasma\n  \n  \n    o   Platelets\n  \n  \n    o   Cryoprecipitate\n  \n  \n    o   Whole blood\n  \n  o   Other\n   \n  \n    ·      \n    Modifiers\n    - The modifiers are controlled by a parameter that is set at each site. It might include things such as washed, irradiated, etc.\n  \n  \n    ·      \n    For All Components--Date/Time Wanted*\n    - The date and time when ALL blood components for this order should be ready that enables the user to order the blood for a future date, such as for a surgery.\n  \n  \n    ·      \n    Urgency*\n    - This list comes from CPRS and might include items such as Routine, Pre-Op, ASAP, or STAT. The urgency applies to all components and diagnostic tests listed under the Selected Components and Tests area.\n  \n  \n    ·      \n    Surgery (conditional)\n    - If the user selects Pre-Op for the urgency, the Surgery field becomes active and the provider can select the surgery to be performed from the drop-down list or enter it manually. If the surgery is not listed, the provider may enter a surgery (the field accepts free-text) because this is not a comprehensive list of surgeries.\n  \n  \n    ·      \n    Reason for Request*\n    - The user can choose a reason from the drop-down list (sites define items in the list using a parameter) or type a free-text entry. This reason for request applies to the entire order.\n  \n  \n    ·      \n    Comment*\n    - If the provider has information that should be passed on with the order, the comments can be added in this field.\n    The comments apply to the entire order. (This is a required field if the user selects the Blood Component \"Other\".)\n  \n  \n    ·      \n    Diagnostic Tests\n    - The items on this list comes from CPRS and enable the provider to request specific tests associated with blood component ordering. When the user selects this item, the fields under blood components are then cleared. The user can see those items again by highlighting the blood component under Selected Blood Components and Tests.\n  \n  \n    ·      \n    Collection Type*\n    - The collection type determines how the specimen should be collected: Lab collect, Ward collect, Send patient to Lab, or Immediate collect, for example.\n  \n  \n    ·      \n    Collection Date/Time\n    *\n    - The date and time enable the user to specify when the sample should be collected.\n  \n   \n  \n    Items required to order each blood component or diagnostic test are marked with an asterisk (*) after the name of the field, such as Reason for Request*.\n  \n  \n    How the Blood Orders Tab Works\n  \n  \n    Ordering blood components and diagnostic tests is different than ordering other items in CPRS because users can place orders for several different blood components and tests in one dialog at the same time. For example, if a user wanted to order platelets, whole blood, and a type and screen, the user could do all of that in the dialog at the same time. To accommodate ordering of multiple items, the Blood Bank Orders tab creates a list of items ordered under the Selected Components and Test area.\n  \n  \n    When the user selects a blood component from the Blood Component drop-down list, the item is immediately added to the Selected Components and Tests area (think of this as a shopping cart like some web sites use). The user can then detail the necessary information for that component, such as quantity, modifiers, the urgency and reason for request, etc.  \n  \n  \n    Note:    As the name implies the For All Components--Date/Time Wanted applies to all blood components. It is NOT possible to set a different time for individual blood components in the order.\n  \n  \n    When the user puts in data for these fields, these values will stay in when the user switches between components or tests. Because the values that apply to the entire order continue to display, the user can select it\n    ems and enter the other values for each component and diagnostic test.\n  \n  \n    Alternatively, the user could select all of the components and tests first, then select each item under the Selected Components and Tests list and fill in each individually. To edit any\n    item, the user must either fill in the fields as soon as the item is selected from the drop-down list, or highlight the item in the Selected Components and Tests list and then edit the fields.\n  \n  \n    Under the Selected Components and Test area, the user can also\n    remove a single item by selecting the item and selecting the Remove button, or if the user wants to remove all the items, the user can select the Remove All button.\n  \n  \n    Based on the set up, CPRS may prompt the user that the selected blood component requires a\n    specific diagnostic test. For example, if the user selects whole blood and the patient does not have a Type and Screen within the last 3 days (3 days is a default, clinical coordinators at the sites can set the number of days based on local policy), the user will see a message under the diagnostic test drop-down box stating that a Type and Screen is required.\n  \n  \n    As the user enters orders, the order text is built in the field at the bottom of the dialog. Thus, the user should review this area to ensure that all necessary information is included with each item.\n  \n  \n    To help the user edit the values that go along with each component and test, several values that apply to the entire order now remain visible:\n  \n  \n    · \n    For all components--Date/Time Wanted\n  \n  \n    · \n    diagnostic test Collection Type\n  \n  \n    · \n    diagnostic test Collection Date/Time\n  \n  \n    · \n    Comments\n  \n  \n    · \n    Reason for Request\n  \n  \n    · \n    Urgency\n  \n   \n  \n    The date wanted can be set for all blood components and also defaults for the diagnostic tests. Modifiers apply only to blood components.\n  \n  \n    Also, when the user moves the f\n    ocus to either the Blood Components or the Diagnostic Tests area, values for the last item entered in that area display so that user can edit the values. If the user wants to edit another item, the user must select it from the Selected Components and Test\n    area first.\n  \n  \n    Configuring the VBECS Dialog\n  \n  \n    Each site can configure some areas of the Blood Component and Diagnostic Test Order Form dialog. A CPRS parameter lets sites decide if the Blood Component area or the Diagnostic Test area is shown on the left of the\n    dialog. The other area then displays next to the first area on the right of the dialog.\n  \n  \n    Sites can also customize the order of the following lists:\n  \n  \n    · \n    The Blood Components\n  \n  \n    · \n    The Diagnostic Tests\n  \n  \n    · \n    The Reason for Request\n  \n   \n  \n    The order of items in these lists is controlled by parameters set by Clinical Application Coordinators (CACs). CACs can therefore put the most used items earlier in the list.\n  \n   \n  \n    Links to items in this topic:\n  \n  \n    · \n      VBECS Patient Information tab\n    \n  \n  \n    · \n      VBECS Blood Bank Orders tab\n    \n  \n  \n    · \n      VBECS Lab Test Results tab\n    \n  \n  \n    · \n      Back to the top\n    \n  \n   \n   \n  \n    The Lab Results Tab\n  \n  \n    The Lab Results tab enables clinicians to view the lab results associated with the selected blood compon\n    ent. If there are lab results in the system when the user selects a blood component, the tab name changes to Lab Results Available. This tab then shows the results from the lab tests designated in VBECS by the administrator at each site. So, for example,\n    t\n    he user might see different lab test results based on whether the user selected whole blood or platelets.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n          The most recent results are displayed, but these results may be from test done some time in the past.

Clinic Infusions enable VistA order checks to function for such medication orders.\nClinic Infusions orders must be placed from a clinic location. When providers select the Clinic Infusions item under the Write Order pane, CPRS will ask the providers to confirm that they are placing a Clinic Infusions order. Either before or after the confirmation dialog appears, providers must assign the encounter location to an appropriate clinic. For outpatients, providers will be prompted if no encounter location has been defined yet and then asked to confirm that they want to order Clinic Medications. For inpatients, providers will be asked to confirm that they want to order Clinic Medications first and then prompted for an appropriate clinic location.\nOther than being ordered from a clinic, the infusion ordering process is almost identical to ordering infusions from any other location. However, to be comprehensive, the steps for Clinic Infusions should be complete in this section of the manual. As they are almost identical, the information in this section is the same as much of the information under the infusions ordering section.\n \nContinuous versus Intermittent Infusion Orders\nIn the Infusion Order dialog, the order type—Continuous or Intermittent— affects whether some fields are available or visible. The two types of IVs are defined as follows:\n\nContinuous IV: an IV that runs at a specified rate (ml/hr, mcg/kg/min, etc.).\nIntermittent IV: an IV administered at scheduled intervals (Q4H, QDAY) or One-Time only, “over a specified period of time” (e.g., “Infuse over 30 min.”).\n\n \nFor Intermittent orders, the Infusion Rate field changes to be Infuse over Time, the Schedule field becomes available (not greyed out), and checkboxes display for the PRN and Give additional Dose Now options. On both dialogs, required fields are identified by an asterisk following the field label (such as Route*, for example). Intermittent orders no longer require a solution to finish the order. Continuous orders still require a solution before the order can be finished. For CPRS to accept the order, the user must enter values in the required fields, including the units.\nFor the Route field, CPRS uses the following rules to define whether it displays a default route for the selected medication:\n\nIf all of the orderable items on the order have the same default medication route defined, CPRS designates the default medication route in the selection list.\nIf one or more orderable items on the order have different default medication routes, no medication route in the selection list will be denoted as the default.\n\n \nRelated Topics\nOne-Step Clinic Administration for IV Medications\nPlacing Continuous Clinic Infusion Orders\nPlacing Intermittent Clinic Infusion Orders\n\n\n","Path::contents/Clinical_Reminders.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/cprswt.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Clinical_Reminders.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/cprswt.css"}],"Path::contents/Clinical_Reminders.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Clinical_Reminders.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Clinical_Reminders.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Clinical_Reminders.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Clinical_Reminders.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Clinical_Reminders.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Clinical_Reminders.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Clinical_Reminders.htm::Title":"Clinical Reminders","Path::contents/Clinical_Reminders.htm::InnerText":"\nConfigure and arrange which clinical reminders are displayed on your cover sheet.\n\n\n","Path::contents/Changing_Views_on_the_Notes_tab.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Changing_Views_on_the_Notes_tab.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"image/CPRS0056_wmf.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Changing_Views_on_the_Notes_tab.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/image/CPRS0056_wmf.gif"},{"origLink":"Improving_the_Tree_View_Custom_View_Display.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Changing_Views_on_the_Notes_tab.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Improving_the_Tree_View_Custom_View_Display.htm"},{"origLink":"Viewing_all_Signed_Notes_for_a_Date_Range.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Changing_Views_on_the_Notes_tab.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Viewing_all_Signed_Notes_for_a_Date_Range.htm"},{"origLink":"Viewing_All_Signed_Notes_by_a_Specific_Author.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Changing_Views_on_the_Notes_tab.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Viewing_All_Signed_Notes_by_a_Specific_Author.htm"},{"origLink":"Viewing_all_Signed_Notes__all_Unsigned_Notes__or_All_Uncosigned_Notes.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Changing_Views_on_the_Notes_tab.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Viewing_all_Signed_Notes__all_Unsigned_Notes__or_All_Uncosigned_Notes.htm"}],"Path::contents/Changing_Views_on_the_Notes_tab.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Changing_Views_on_the_Notes_tab.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Changing_Views_on_the_Notes_tab.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Changing_Views_on_the_Notes_tab.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Changing_Views_on_the_Notes_tab.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Changing_Views_on_the_Notes_tab.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Changing_Views_on_the_Notes_tab.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Changing_Views_on_the_Notes_tab.htm::Title":"Changing Views on the Notes tab","Path::contents/Changing_Views_on_the_Notes_tab.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Date,Date:range","Path::contents/Changing_Views_on_the_Notes_tab.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Changing Views on the Notes tab\n  \n  \n    Changing the view of the Notes tab allows you to focus the list of notes on one of several criteria.

From within the patient's\n    CPRS medical record, the clinician enters an order for a consultation or procedure. The ordering clinician may first have to enter Encounter Information.\n  \n  \n    2.     The consult service receives an alert and a printed SF 513.\n    The receiving service can then accept the consult, forward it to another service, or send it back to the originating clinician for more information.\n  \n  \n    3.     The consult service accepts or rejects the consult request.

In simple terms, this means that if CCOW-compliant applications are sharing context and one of the applications changes to a different patient, the other applications will change to that patient as well.\n  \n  \n    The VA purchased Sentillion's Vergence context management software to work with VistA.\n  \n  \n    To use the CCOW standard, VistA set up must include these two components:\n  \n  \n    ·     a context vault, which is a\n    server on the VA LAN that tracks context for each clinical workstation\n  \n  \n    ·     desktop components installed on each workstation that will use CCOW\n  \n   \n  \n    To allow VistA GUI applications to use context management, the developers must make the necessary changes to HL7 messages for each application to allow synchronization.

If you were in Care Management, which is also CCOW-compliant, and clicked the CPRS Chart link, the CPRS GUI chart would be launched and would bring up the same patient that had focus in Care Management.

The VA's implementation of digital signatures for these medications also allows sites to limit, if needed, the outpatient controlled substance pharmacy schedules (pharmacy schedules 2-5) a prescriber has permission to prescribe. Of course, the site can also allow the provider to write for all schedules.\n  \n  \n    To digitally sign the controlled substances outpatient orders requires what is called two-factor authentication, which means that in addition to entering their electronic signature, the providers must use\n    their smart card (Personal Identification Verification, or PIV cards, for example), card readers attached to workstations, Personal Identification Numbers (PIN), and digital certificates to digitally sign the orders.\n  \n  \n    When the provider attempts to digitally sign the order, CPRS checks for a valid DEA registration number, VA number, or Detoxification/Maintenance number for the prescriber and to see if the provider is authorized to write medications for the specified pharmacy schedule to which the selected medication belongs. It uses a digital certificate on the card to sign the order.\n  \n  \n    By digita\n    lly signing the controlled substance order, the prescriber acknowledges and accepts the following as mandated by the DEA:\n  \n  By completing the two-factor authentication protocol at this time, you are legally signing the prescription(s) and authorizing the transmission of the above information to the pharmacy for dispersing. The two-factor authentication protocol may only be completed by the practitioner whose name and DEA registration number appear above.\n   \n  \n    How Does CPRS Show a Digital Signature?\n  \n  \n    CPRS displays\n    order information in several places where users will be able to see that an outpatient controlled substance order was digitally signed.\n  \n  \n    Cover Sheet:\n    If the order has been digitally signed, the detailed order display from right-clicking the order on the Cover Sheet where it now shows \"Elec Signature:\" will show \"Dig Signature:\".\n  \n   \n  \n    Orders Tab and Meds Tab:\n    If the order has been digitally signed, the detailed order display from right-clicking the order on the Orders tab or from selecting it and choosing Detail\n    s from the View menu where it now shows \"Elec Signature:\" will show \"Dig Signature:\".\n  \n   \n  \n    Reports Tab:\n    On the Daily Order Summary and Order Summary by a Date Range reports, the signature type will be Digital. On the Chart Copy Summary report, the indicator shows that the order was digitally signed.\n  \n   \n  \n    Digitally Signing Orders\n  \n  \n    VA employees have been given a smart card, such as a Personal Identification Verification (PIV) card, to improve security. Digitally signing orders for controlled substances\n    is one area where providers will use their smart cards.\n  \n  \n    A Personal Identification Number (PIN) controls access to the smart card. When a user needs to digitally sign an order, the user must be at a workstation with a card reader and must insert the smart card and enter the card's current PIN.\n  \n  \n    To sign controlled substance orders, digitally sign the order by\n  \n  \n    ·      Proceeding with the normal electronic signature process.\n  \n  \n    ·      Selecting the controlled substance orders that you want to sign.

Document Templates (overview)\n  \n  \n    With the CPRS GUI, you can create document templates to quickly add commonly used text and \n      Template Fields\n    \n    when writing or editing progress notes, completing consults, or writing discharge summaries. Template import and export utilities are available through the Template Editor Tools menu. A print button has been added to the Preview Templates dialog so that you may either view the template on the screen or send it to a printer.\n  \n  \n    You can go to the following areas of this overview:\n  \n  \n    · \n      Personal and Shared Templates\n    \n    talks about the difference between shared and personal templates.\n  \n  \n    · \n      Types of Templates\n    \n    discusses templates, group templates, and folders.\n  \n  \n    · \n      Arranging Topics for Ease of Use\n    \n    talks very briefly about grouping templates.\n  \n  \n    · \n      Creating and Modifying Shared and Personal Templates\n    \n    explains uses and features of Template Editor.\n  \n  \n    · \n      Using Templates to Create Documents\n    \n    gives a brief look at how to add template text and objects to documents.\n  \n  \n    · \n      Template Fields\n    \n    explains how to add text fields to templates.\n  \n   \n  \n    Personal and Shared Templates\n  \n  \n    You can create and use your own templates or you can use shared templates created by your Clinical Coordinator. The icon legend shows you the various icons and what they represent.\n  \n  \n    ·      \n    Personal templates.\n    Authorized users can create personal templates. You can copy and paste text into a template, type in new content, add \n      Template Fields\n    \n    , or copy a shared template into your personal templates folder. A shared template that you simply copy into your personal templates folder without changing continues to be updated whenever the original template is changed or modified in the Shared Templates folder. Once you personalize or change the copy of the shared template in your personal templates folder, the icon used to represent it changes and it become a personal template. From that moment on, the personal template is not related to the shared template and is not updated with the original. Personal template and folder icons have a folded upper right corner. In the tree view, personal\n    template and folder icons have a folded corner.\n  \n   \n  \n    ·      \n    Shared templates\n    . Only members of the Clinical Coordinator ASU class can create shared templates. Shared templates are available to all users. Coordinators can copy and paste text into a template, type in\n    new content, add Template Fields, or copy a personal template and modify it as needed. In the tree view, shared template and folder icons do not have a folded corner.\n  \n   \n   \n  \n    Types of Templates\n  \n  \n    When you create templates, you can go directly into the template editor, type in text, and add TIU objects and \n      Template Fields\n    \n    , or if you are in a document and type in something you will use repeatedly, you simply select that text, right-click, select Create New Template, and the editor comes up with the selected text in the editing area.\n  \n  \n    You can create individual templates, group templates, dialog templates, folders, or link templates to Reminder dialogs.\n  \n  \n    ·      \n    Templates\n    contain text, TIU\n    objects,and \n      Template Fields\n    \n    that you can place in a document.\n  \n  \n    ·      \n    Group templates\n    contain text and TIU objects and can also contain other templates. If you place a group template in a document, all text and objects in the group template and all the templates it contains (unless they are \n      excluded from the group template\n    \n    ) will be placed in the document. You can also expand the view of the group template and place the individual templates it contains in a document one at a time.\n  \n  \n    ·      \n    Dialog\n    templates are like group templates in that they contain other templates. You can place a number of other templates under a dialog template. Then, when you drag the dialog template in your document, a dialog appears that has a check box for each template under the Dialog template. The person writing the document can check the items they want and click OK to place them in the note.\n  \n  \n    ·      \n    Folders\n    are like folders or directories in a file system. They are used to group and organize templates. It is there to hold templates and help in navigating the template tree view. For example, you might create a folder called \"radiology\" for templates, group templates, and other folders relating to radiology.\n  \n  \n    ·      \n    Reminder Dialogs\n    can have templates linked to them. This allows templates to place orders, enter PCE information, and enter vitals and mental health data. Refer to Creating Reminder Dialogs\n    for the procedure.\n  \n   \n  \n    Arranging Templates for Ease of Use\n  \n  \n    You can use file cabinets and folders\n    to group similar templates together to make them easier to find and use. For example, you may want to place all of the pulmonary templates together rather than listing the templates in alphabetical order.\n  \n  \n    Using Templates to Create Documents\n  \n  \n    Once you or your clinical coordinator has created templates, adding them to a document is easy. When you create a new note, a Templates drawer appears. When you click the drawer, it opens to show you the templates that are available.\n  \n  \n    Group templates, dialogs, and folders may have a plus next to them. Click the plus to expand the tree view and see the templates they contain. Click a minus sign to collapse the tree view, hiding the templates under that item.\n  \n  \n    When you find the template you want to place in a\n    document, you can drag-and-drop it into the document, double-click it, or right-click and choose Insert Template. The text and objects will\n    appear where the cursor was a few seconds later.\n  \n   \n  \n      Back to the top\n    \n   \n  \n    Related topics\n  \n  \n      Creating Personal Document Templates\n    \n  \n      Creating Shared Document Templates\n    \n  \n      Generating a Template from a TIU Object or Note Title\n    \n  \n      Editing Document Templates\n    \n  \n      Previewing a Template\n    \n  \n      Copying Document Templates\n    \n  \n      Searching for Document Templates\n    \n  \n      Deleting Document Templates\n    \n  \n\n","Path::contents/Document_titles.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/cprswt.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Document_titles.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/cprswt.css"}],"Path::contents/Document_titles.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Document_titles.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Document_titles.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Document_titles.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Document_titles.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Document_titles.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Document_titles.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Document_titles.htm::Title":"Document titles","Path::contents/Document_titles.htm::InnerText":"\nSelect document titles to be added to your list of titles.

Electronic signatures, which have been available for some time, require an electronic signature code that can be created at your\n    site. Digital signatures in CPRS are now required to comply with new Drug Enforcement Agency's (DEA) regulations for identifying a prescriber that orders outpatient controlled substances.\n  \n  \n    There are three different levels of keys that influence what can be\n    done with orders, including what dialog CPRS brings up when signing orders. Although actual practice at each site may vary, the three levels are usually referred to in these ways:\n  \n  \n    ·      OREMAS is the clerk key\n  \n  \n    ·      ORELSE is the nurse key\n  \n  \n    ·      ORES is the provider key\n  \n   \n  \n    In CPRS, users who hold the ORES key have additional privileges and are sometimes required to enter more information than those who hold the other two keys. ORES key holders (usually an ordering provider) must enter information regarding service connection, environmental conditions or specific treatment factors, such as ionizing radiation, Agent Orange, etc.\n  \n  \n    This section describes the differences between electronic and digital signatures, gives an overview of service connection and\n    treatment factors, and then gives the steps for the various ways users will sign orders. For example, users can sign orders several different ways:\n  \n  \n    ·      \n    Review / Sign Changes...\n    enables users to sign all orders from the current ordering session. Using this method, the user could write a number of orders and create documents and then sign all items at the same time.\n  \n  \n    ·      \n    Sign selected...\n    enables users to highlight one or more orders and then sign them. When the dialog displays, only the selected orders or documents\n    will display for signature.\n  \n  \n    ·      \n    Select New Patient\n    brings up the signature dialog that includes all unsigned orders for the current patient before opening another patient record. The orders are broken into three groups, the user's orders from this ordering\n    session, the user's unsigned orders for the patient from previous ordering sessions, and unsigned orders for the patient written by other users. The user can then select and deselect the orders to be signed.\n  \n  \n    ·      \n    Exiting the chart\n    (closing CPRS) brings up the\n    same dialog as selecting a new patient (see above).\n  \n   \n  \n    CPRS provides three methods for signing orders and documents. You can sign orders and documents together from the Review / Sign Changes dialog or you can sign orders and documents separately using the Sign Selected Orders and Sign Documents Now commands.\n  \n   \n  \n    Related topics\n  \n  \n      Digital Signature: PKI Overview\n    \n  \n      Review / Sign Changes Dialog\n    \n  \n      Sign Selected Orders Command\n    \n  \n      Sign Note Now\n     \n      and Sign Discharge Summary Now Commands\n    \n  \n      Add to Signature List\n    \n  \n      Viewing Unsigned Notes or Discharge Summaries\n    \n  \n      Identify Additional Signers\n    \n  \n      Electronic Signature (overview)\n    \n\n","Path::contents/Encounter.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Encounter.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Entering_Current_Activities_Encounter.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Encounter.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Entering_Current_Activities_Encounter.htm"}],"Path::contents/Encounter.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Encounter.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Encounter.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Encounter.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Encounter.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Encounter.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Encounter.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Encounter.htm::Title":"Encounter","Path::contents/Encounter.htm::InnerText":"\nEncounter\nAn encounter is a visit (or telephone call) with a health care provider.

You can also highlight a provider’s name and make that provider the primary provider for the encounter.\n \nB.)       Diagnosis: Enter the diagnoses for this encounter using either Diagnosis Section categories and accompanying diagnoses or use the Other Diagnosis… button to search for a diagnosis. In the Diagnosis Section pane, CPRS displays the sources for prepopulated diagnoses, such as the Problem List Items and any encounter forms your site has set up for the location or clinic. With the Other Diagnosis… button, the provider types all or part of a term and searches for diagnoses containing the specified text. The provider may need to revise the search with a broader or narrower term to locate the correct diagnosis.\n1.       For the Diagnosis Section: To use the Problem List Items or other Encounter forms available, select the Diagnosis tab if it is not already selected.\n2.       Select the appropriate source if one is available in the list, such as Problem List Items or an Encounter form that your site has made available. When you select the source, the associated diagnoses display in the pane to the right, which will now have the name of the source above the pane.\n3.       Use the check boxes to select the appropriate items from the list. As you select a problem or diagnosis, CPRS will check if the item has an active code, a specific code, and is in the right coding system.\n \n\n \nThis screen shows a diagnosis on the Encounter form with an inactive code. If the provider selects a diagnosis, CPRS requires the diagnosis to have an appropriate active code. With ICD-10, all items from the Problem List are now displayed on the Diagnosis tab. Providers could see both active and inactive ICD-9 codes and SNOMED-CT codes. All displayed codes can be selected, but CPRS may require the provider to locate an active code or one from a different coding system. For example, if a user selects a SNOMED or ICD-9 code for an encounter after the ICD-10 activation date, CPRS will prompt the provider to locate an appropriate ICD-10 code.\n \n\nIf a user selects a diagnosis or procedure with an inactive code, the above dialog will display telling the user that the code is inactive and that the user should change it. This will change after the ICD-10 activation date because the problem will need to be updated from the Diagnosis tab, not the Problem List tab\n \n4.     If the item selected can be used to check out the encounter, it will display under the Selected Diagnoses section. Proceed to step 7. If another dialog displays proceed to step 5. If a provider tries to enter a diagnosis or procedure that has an inactive (shown with a hash or # symbol either because the code itself has become inactive or because it is from a superseded coding system) or unspecified code (799.9 in ICD-9 or R69 in ICD-10) associated with it, CPRS does not accept that selection and displays the search dialog for the provider to locate an appropriate diagnosis.\n\n5.     Enter a term or some text to search and select the Search button. Matching terms will be displayed under the Term pane. Before the activation date, the dialog displays possible ICD-9 codes to check out the encounter. The description, code, and coding system will display. After ICD-10 activation, the dialog will display ICD-10 codes, with the description, code, and coding system.\n6.     Highlight the appropriate term and select OK.  After ICD-10 activation, providers may see terms displayed with a tree view containing broader terms with a plus sign or arrow that they will need to expand to find a more specific term.\n7.    (Conditional) After ICD-10 activation, if the provider updates the ICD code, it may trigger a need to update the problem on the Problem List with a new SNOMED code. If it does, a dialog will display and the provider will need to search for and select a SNOMED term for the Problem list. After the term is selected, the problem list will be updated, but the provider may need to refresh to see the change on the Problems tab.\n\nNote:     If the provider cancels the process when selecting a SNOMED term, the entire process is canceled, including the ICD code selection that was previously performed.\n8.     After CPRS has a valid code, the code will display in the pane below with its name, coding system, and code. The first diagnosis you choose will be the primary diagnosis by default.\n9.      If you need to change a different diagnosis in the list to be the primary diagnosis, highlight the item and select the Primary button.\n10.    If a diagnosis has been entered mistakenly, highlight the diagnosis and select Remove.\n11.    If you need to add a comment, type it into the Comment field.\n-OR-\n \n1.       To use the Other Diagnosis… button to select a diagnosis: Select the Other Diagnosis… button. CPRS now displays the Lookup Diagnosis dialog.\n2.      In the Search for Diagnosis field, type a term or some text that refers to the diagnosis (such as “diabet” for diabetes) and select Search. The Lexicon is then searched and a list of matching terms is displayed. Plus signs next to terms indicate that there are terms underneath it that are more specific or synonymous. When the user highlights a term, the term, coding system and code are displayed below the list of terms.\n\nThe Lookup Diagnosis dialog enables users to search for the appropriate term to describe the patient’s condition. As shown above, after ICD-10 activation, the results will be in a tree view and providers may need to expand the category to locate a specific term. If too many terms are found, CPRS will prompt the user to be more specific.\n \n3.    If appropriate terms are not found, refine your search terms and select Search again.\n4.     Highlight the appropriate diagnosis. If the display shows a tree view, note that you must select a specific term and not an item with a plus sign in front of it. When a term is highlighted, the diagnosis is then displayed below the Term pane with its term, code, and coding system. Verify that this is the diagnosis you want. If not, locate the best term. If it is, select OK. The diagnosis will then be added to the pane below the Other Diagnosis… button, showing the name of the term, the coding system, and the code.\n \n \n\n\nThis screen shows a diagnosis on the Encounter form with an inactive code. If the user selects a diagnosis, CPRS requires the user to select an appropriate active code. All items from the Problem List are now displayed on the Diagnosis tab. Providers could see both active and inactive ICD-9 codes and SNOMED-CT codes. All displayed codes can be selected, but CPRS may require the provider to locate an active code or one from a different coding system. For example, if a user selects a SNOMED or ICD-9 code for an encounter after the ICD-10 activation date, CPRS will prompt the provider to locate an appropriate ICD-10 code.\n \n\nIf a user selects a diagnosis or procedure with an inactive code, the above dialog will display telling the user that the code is inactive and that the user should change it. This will change after the ICD-10 activation date because the problem will need to be updated from the Diagnosis tab, not the Problem List tab.\n \n5.    (OPTIONAL) To add the diagnosis to the Problem List, highlight the diagnosis (to add all use the Select All button), select the Add to Problem List check box.

Select the arrow button (\n    >\n    ) to remove an item.\n  \n  3.      To control how the reminders are displayed on the Cover Sheet, do one of the following:\n  \n    o     select the \"\n    Display Order\" option (at the bottom of the dialog) to display the reminders in their current order. To move a reminder up or down the list, select the reminder and click either the up or down arrow.\n  \n  \n    o     select the \"Alphabetical\" option (at the bottom of the dialog) to display the reminders in alphabetical order.\n  \n   \n  \n    Clinical Reminders and Reminder Categories Displayed on Cover Sheet\n  \n  \n    This advanced dialog displays reminders in a way that allows the user to better manage the reminders that are displayed on the Cover Sheet. The dialog consists mainly of three large list fields. The \"Cover Sheet Reminders (Cumulative List)\" field displays selected information on the reminders that will be displayed on the Cover Sheet. The \"Available Reminders & Categories\" field lists all available reminders and serves as a selection list.\n    The \"User Level Reminders\" field displays the reminders that you have added to or removed from the cumulative list.\n  \n  \n    You may sort the Reminders in the \"Cover Sheet Reminders (Cumulative List)\" field by clicking on any of the column headers. Click on the Seq (Sequence) column header to view the Reminders in the order in which they will be displayed on your Cover Sheet.\n  \n  \n    An icon legend is displayed to the right of the \"Cover Sheet Reminders (Cumulative List)\" field. A folder icon represents a group of Reminders\n    while a red alarm clock represents an individual Reminder. A Reminder with a plus sign in the first column has been added to the list while a Reminder with a minus sign in the first column has been removed from the list. The user cannot remove reminders\n    with a padlock icon in the first column.\n  \n   \n  \n    Cover Sheet Reminders (Cumulative List)\n  \n  \n    The Level column of the \"Cover Sheet Reminders (Cumulative List)\" field displays the originating authority of the Reminder, which can include System, Division, Location, User\n    Class, and User. Reminders on this list that display a small gray padlock icon at the beginning of the line cannot be removed. These Reminders are mandatory. The Seq (Sequence) column defines the order in which the Reminders will be displayed on the Cover\n    Sheet. If there are two or more Reminders with the same sequence number, the Reminders will be listed by level (System, Division, Service, Location, User class, User).\n  \n   \n  \n    Location shown in Cumulative List\n  \n  \n    Select this drop-down box and select a location. The\n    Reminders assigned to that location appear on the Cumulative List.\n  \n   \n  \n    Available Reminders & Categories\n  \n  \n    This field displays all of the Reminders and Categories available to the user. Notice that the reminder name is in parentheses after the print name. Categories are groups of related Reminders that can be added as a group. Individual reminders within a category can be removed from the User Level Reminders field. Highlight a Reminder or Category from the field and click the right arrow to add them to the User\n    Level Reminders field.\n  \n   \n  \n    User-Level Reminders\n  \n  \n    This field displays all of the Reminders selected by the user. To add a Reminder to your User Level Reminders, highlight the desired Reminder in the Available Reminders & Categories field and click the right arr\n    ow button. To delete a Reminder from your User Level Reminders field, highlight the Reminder in the User Level Reminders field and click the left arrow.\n  \n  \n    You may determine the order in which the Reminders will be displayed on the Cover Sheet by changing the\n    Reminder's sequence number. For example, to place a Reminder at the top of the Reminders list, assign it a number less than 10. To change the order of User Level Reminders, highlight Reminders and click the up arrow or down arrow until the desired order is achieved.\n  \n  \n    You may remove any or all non-mandatory Reminders assigned at any level by adding the Reminder to your User Level and then clicking the\n    Remove\n    button.\n  \n   \n  \n    Cover Sheet Reminders\n  \n  \n    Once you have the cumulative List, as you want it, select\n    View Cover Sheet Reminders\n    to view how the reminders will be displayed on your Cover Sheet for the specified locations.\n  \n  \n    Once you have made all of the desired changes to the Reminders that will be displayed on the Cover Sheet, select\n    OK\n    .\n  \n   \n  \n    Other Parameters...\n  \n  \n    To set the initial chart tab, Meds tab date range, or Encounter date range select\n    Other Parameters\n    .\n  \n   \n  \n    Chart Tabs\n  \n  \n    Select the drop-down field and select the chart tab with which CPRS should open. select the check box if you want CPRS to remain on the last selected tab when you change patients.\n  \n  \n    Note:      For this change to take effect, you must exit CPRS and log back in.\n  \n   \n  \n    Meds Tab Date Ranges\n  \n  \n    1.     Enter a start date by doing one of the following:\n  \n  \n    o      Typing a date (e.g. 6/21/01 or June 21, 2001).\n  \n  o      Typing a date formula (e.g. t-200).\n  o      Pressing the  button to bring up a calendar and select a date.\n   \n  \n    2.     Enter a stop date by doing one of the following:\n  \n  o      Typing a date (e.g. 6/21/01 or June 21, 2001).\n  o      Typing a date formula (e.g. t-200).\n  o      Pressing the  button to bring up a calendar and select a date.\n   \n  \n    3.     When you have entered the dates, go to another option on this dialog or select\n    OK\n    .\n  \n   \n  \n    Encounter Appointments Date Range\n  \n  \n    This option enables users to set the date range for Encounter appointments that CPRS displays on the Cover Sheet and the Encounter form. The two values are based on today;s date and represent how many days in the past and how many days in the future the user may set for\n    CPRS to display appointments.\n  \n  \n    To set these values, use the following steps:\n  \n  \n    1.     In the Start Date field, type or use the arrows to select a number of days in the past CPRS should display appointments.\n  \n  \n    2.     In the Stop Date field, type or use the arrows to select a number of days in the future CPRS should display appointments.\n  \n  \n    Note:      Your site can set a parameter to give you a warning if you select an appointment too far in the future. CPRS will display a warning to let you know that you may be going against local policy. This message is just a warning and you may proceed.\n  \n   \n  \n    3.     When you have entered the dates, go to another option on this dialog or select\n    OK\n    .\n  \n   \n  \n    Related Topics\n  \n  \n      Personal Preferences (Tools | Options)\n    \n  \n      Notifications Tab (Tools | Options)\n    \n  \n      Order Checks Tab (Tools | Options)\n    \n  \n      Lists/Teams Tab (Tools | Options)\n    \n  \n      Notes Tab (Tools | Options)\n    \n  \n      Reports Tab (Tools | Options)\n    \n  \n      Graphs Tab (Tools | Options)\n    \n\n","Path::contents/Forwarding_a_Notification_to_Another_User.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Forwarding_a_Notification_to_Another_User.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Notifications__Notifications_and_Alerts.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Forwarding_a_Notification_to_Another_User.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Notifications__Notifications_and_Alerts.htm"},{"origLink":"Sorting_Notifications_and_Viewing_Comments_of_Forwarded_Alerts.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Forwarding_a_Notification_to_Another_User.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Sorting_Notifications_and_Viewing_Comments_of_Forwarded_Alerts.htm"},{"origLink":"Removing_Notifications.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Forwarding_a_Notification_to_Another_User.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Removing_Notifications.htm"},{"origLink":"Processing_Notifications.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Forwarding_a_Notification_to_Another_User.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Processing_Notifications.htm"},{"origLink":"Deferring_Notifications.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Forwarding_a_Notification_to_Another_User.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Deferring_Notifications.htm"}],"Path::contents/Forwarding_a_Notification_to_Another_User.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Forwarding_a_Notification_to_Another_User.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Forwarding_a_Notification_to_Another_User.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Forwarding_a_Notification_to_Another_User.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Forwarding_a_Notification_to_Another_User.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Forwarding_a_Notification_to_Another_User.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Forwarding_a_Notification_to_Another_User.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Forwarding_a_Notification_to_Another_User.htm::Title":"Forwarding a Notification to Another User","Path::contents/Forwarding_a_Notification_to_Another_User.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Forward notifications,Notifications,Notifications:forward","Path::contents/Forwarding_a_Notification_to_Another_User.htm::InnerText":"\nForwarding a Notification to Another User\n1.     Bring up the Patient Selection screen, either by launching CPRS or if you are already running CPRS, selecting File | Select New Patient.\n2.     Highlight the notifications that you want to forward and click Forward.\nNote: To select a number of notifications in a row, click the first item, hold down the Shift key, and click the last item.

This tab includes all predefined views from the following sources:\n  \n  ·       Public views you or others--your site's IRM staff, for example--have created. (Only authorized users can create public views.)\n  ·       Private views you have created.\n  \n    ·       Personal Lab Groups that you have created. These lab groups are defined in the\n    Lab Worksheet report.\n  \n   \n  \n    Users can now also access other users'  personal views and lab groups that they have defined to build new views. Users with proper authority can save personal views as public views by simply renaming and saving as a public view. Users can also save public views as a personal view and then alter it to suit their personal preferences.\n  \n   \n  \n    To display view definition, use these steps:\n  \n  \n    1.     Highlight the view name.\n  \n  \n    2.     Select\n    View Definition\n    from the pop-up menu.\n  \n  \n    The definition with them display in a pane below View list.\n  \n   \n  \n    Take the following steps to create new views:\n  \n  \n    1.     Access the Define Views or Select Items and Define Views dialog box using one of the these four \n      methods\n    \n    .\n  \n  \n    2.     Select\n    All Items\n    in the\n    Select Items using\n    area located at the top of the dialog.\n  \n  \n    3.     Select a data source from the\n    Source\n    list.\n  \n  \n    CPRS displays in the\n    Items\n    list all items associated with this source.\n  \n   \n  \n    4.     If you know you want to include all items, double-click the source to add it--and its associated items--to the\n    Items for Graphing\n    list.\n    You can also add all items for the source by clicking the \n    button.\n  \n  \n    -or-\n  \n  \n    Double-click individual items you want to ad\n    d to the\n    Items for Graphing\n    list.

When you click the primary sources (\n    Anatomic Pathology\n    or\n    Microbiology\n    ), CPRS graphing displays their sub sources in its\n    Items\n    list. If you add to the\n    Items for Graphing\n    list sub sources from the\n    Items\n    list, you automatically add all items associated with the sub sources. To add individual items associated with sub sources, select the sub sources from the\n    Source\n    list.\n  \n  \n    o     CPRS moves all selected items to the\n    Items for Graphing\n    list. If you select duplicate items from different sources, CPRS merges the duplicate items when you add them to the\n    Items for Graphing\n    list.\n  \n   \n  \n    5.     (Optional) You can remove items from the\n    Items for Graphing\n    list by double-clicking them. You can also use the \n    button or the \n    button to remove items.\n  \n  \n    6.     Repeat steps 2-5 until you have selected all items that you want to include in your view.\n  \n  \n    7.     Select\n    Save Personal\n    to save these items in a personal view\n    or, if you are authorized to do so, select\n    Save Public\n    to save the items in a view that is available to all users.\n  \n  \n    8.     In the\n    Save your Personal View\n    or\n    Save this Public View\n    dialog box, type a name for your new view. CPRS saves view names in all capital letters and displays them using title caps. Therefore, you cannot use capitalization schemes to save different\n    views that have the same name. You must give each view a new name unless you plan to overwrite an existing view.\n  \n  \n    9.     Select\n    OK\n    .\n  \n  \n    Your view is now available on the\n    Source\n    list in

Bars representing hospital admissions begin at the date and time of admission and end at the date and time of discharge. Visit representations begin at the appointment date and time and end at the date and time of the visit's end. Because visit durations are often short, visit representations are typically vertical lines, rather than bars. When visit durations are unavailable, CPRS graphing uses its default duration of one hour.\n          \n           \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n           \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            _______________________________________________________________________________________________\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            Events:\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            CPRS graphing displays as single events all items that are\n            not\n            laboratory tests, vitals measurements, medications (inpatient, non-VA, or outpatient), or visits. Like representations for admissions and visits, representations for single events use only the\n            horizontal axis. CPRS graphing uses triangle-shaped representations to mark these items. (Color, shape, and height differentiate item markers.) It graphs administration times for BCMA medications as events.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n           \n        \n        \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n           \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            _______________________________________________________________________________________________\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            Medications:\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            As it does with admissions and visits, CPRS graphing displays medications as bars that indicate a period of time. In the case of outpatient medications, bars begin on the horizontal axis at the release date of the medications. End dates are based on the following calculation: medication release date + number of days supply = end date. For inpatient and non-VA medications, bars begin at medication\n            s\n            tart times and dates and end at medication stop times and dates. In the case of non-VA medications, if no stop date exists, CPRS graphing uses the current date as the stop date.\n          \n          \n            CPRS graphing differentiates multiple medications by color and vertically offsets them to ensure the visibility of overlapping bars.\n          \n          \n            Important:\n            Healthcare professionals have no reliable way to determine whether patients do or do not take their outpatient medications. Use caution when graphing relationships between outpatient medications and other items.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n           \n        \n        \n           \n        \n      \n      \n        \n           \n        \n        \n           \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            _______________________________________________________________________________________________\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            Vitals:\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            CPRS graphing displays vitals measurements as points on two axes.

Thus, they are not a different kind of note, but simply notes created in a way that\n    speeds text entry and signing for a group of patients that have the same treatment or therapy while still allowing personalization of each note and encounter for the patient.\n  \n\n","Path::contents/Hiding_Child_Templates.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Hiding_Child_Templates.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Creating_Personal_Document_Templates.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Hiding_Child_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Creating_Personal_Document_Templates.htm"},{"origLink":"Creating_Shared_Document_Templates.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Hiding_Child_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Creating_Shared_Document_Templates.htm"},{"origLink":"Generating_a_Template_from_a_TIU_Object_or_Note_Title.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Hiding_Child_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Generating_a_Template_from_a_TIU_Object_or_Note_Title.htm"},{"origLink":"Editing_Document_Templates.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Hiding_Child_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Editing_Document_Templates.htm"},{"origLink":"Copying_Document_Templates.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Hiding_Child_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm"},{"origLink":"Searching_for_Document_Templates.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Hiding_Child_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Searching_for_Document_Templates.htm"},{"origLink":"Deleting_Document_Templates.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Hiding_Child_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Deleting_Document_Templates.htm"}],"Path::contents/Hiding_Child_Templates.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Hiding_Child_Templates.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Hiding_Child_Templates.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Hiding_Child_Templates.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Hiding_Child_Templates.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Hiding_Child_Templates.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Hiding_Child_Templates.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Hiding_Child_Templates.htm::Title":"Hiding Child Templates","Path::contents/Hiding_Child_Templates.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Template,Template:hiding child templates","Path::contents/Hiding_Child_Templates.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Hiding Child Templates\n  \n  \n    To make child templates unavailable from the template drawer, follow these steps:\n  \n  \n    1.     Start the Template Editor by selecting\n    Options\n    |\n    Edit Templates\n    from the Notes tab.\n  \n  \n    2.     Select\n    Hide Dialog\n    Items from the Dialog Properties option group.\n  \n  \n    3.     Select\n    OK\n    .\n  \n   \n  \n    Related topics\n  \n  \n      Creating Personal Document Templates\n    \n  \n      Creating Shared Document Templates\n    \n  \n      Generating a Template from a TIU Object or Note Title\n    \n  \n      Editing Document Templates\n    \n  \n      Copying Document Templates\n    \n  \n      Searching for Document Templates\n    \n  \n      Deleting Document Templates\n    \n\n","Path::contents/Health_summaries.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Health_summaries.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"}],"Path::contents/Health_summaries.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Health_summaries.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Health_summaries.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Health_summaries.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Health_summaries.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Health_summaries.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Health_summaries.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Health_summaries.htm::Title":"Health summaries","Path::contents/Health_summaries.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Health Summary\n  \n  \n    A Health Summary is a clinically-oriented, structured report that extracts many kinds of data from DHCP and displays it in a standard format.

Improving the Tree View Custom View Display\n  CPRS enables users to set a maximum number of notes that should display when the Notes tab loads. The purpose of defining a maximum number of notes is to avoid loading a large amount of information that might slow performance. When there is a value in the Max Number to Return field, CPRS has some additional features on the tree view: a “Show More” item and another display category called “Older signed notes with recent addenda”.\n   \n  Show More \n  If the user has more notes available than the maximum allowed, a “Show More” entry displays in the tree view. If the user double clicks “Show More”, CPRS downloads another set of notes as the initial maximum.  If there are still more notes available, “Show More” appears again until there are no more notes to display.\n  \n    For example, if the selected patient has 300 total notes and the Maximum Number of Notes is set to 30, when the Notes tabImproving the Tree View Custom View Display initially opens, 30 Notes will be downloaded, and their information displayed in the tree view. A Show More item will display at the end of the tree view because there are more notes. If the user selects Show More, another 30 notes will be downloaded and listed, so 60 items now show in the tree view. If the user selects Show More again, another 30 notes and the Show More item will display. This will continue until all the notes have been listed. \n   \n  \n    This shows the Show More item to additional groups of notes.\n  \n  \n     \n  Older signed notes with recent addenda \n  Sometimes one or more notes outside the maximum range will have an addendum inside the range. These notes are added to the bottom of the list, under the date of the parent note.  In this example, the last two notes have recent addenda but are well outside the range of the rest of the notes.  This makes it appear that there are no notes between the last normal note (dated April 2019) and the older parent note with the recent addendum (dated March 2009).\n   \n  \n    This shows the notes with addenda as they previously display. \n  \n   \n  To prevent the appearance of a gap in notes, these older notes are now separated from the rest of the notes after the “Show More” entry, marked with the label “Older signed notes with recent addenda”.\n  \n    This is the older signed notes with recent addenda as it is now.\n  \n   \n  \n    Related Topics\n  \n  \n      Changing Views on the Notes Tab\n    \n  \n      Viewing All of the Progress Notes Under a Particular Heading\n    \n  \n      Viewing all Signed Notes, All Unsigned Notes, or All Uncosigned Notes\n    \n  \n      Viewing all Signed Notes by a Specific Author\n    \n  \n      Viewing all Signed Notes for a Date Range\n    \n  \n      Finding Specific Text in a Document\n    \n   \n\n","Path::contents/Identify_Additional_Signers.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Identify_Additional_Signers.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Provider_Selection_Critieria_for_Similar_Names.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Identify_Additional_Signers.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Provider_Selection_Critieria_for_Similar_Names.htm"},{"origLink":"Electronic_Signature_(overview).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Identify_Additional_Signers.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Electronic_Signature_(overview).htm"},{"origLink":"Review___Sign_Changes_Dialog.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Identify_Additional_Signers.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Review___Sign_Changes_Dialog.htm"},{"origLink":"Sign_Selected_Orders.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Identify_Additional_Signers.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Sign_Selected_Orders.htm"},{"origLink":"Sign_Document_Now.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Identify_Additional_Signers.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Sign_Document_Now.htm"},{"origLink":"Signing_Orders_before_Selecting_a_New_Patient_or_Exiting_CPRS.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Identify_Additional_Signers.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Signing_Orders_before_Selecting_a_New_Patient_or_Exiting_CPRS.htm"},{"origLink":"Add_to_Signature_List.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Identify_Additional_Signers.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Add_to_Signature_List.htm"},{"origLink":"Viewing_Unsigned_Notes_or_Discharge_Summaries.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Identify_Additional_Signers.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Viewing_Unsigned_Notes_or_Discharge_Summaries.htm"}],"Path::contents/Identify_Additional_Signers.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Identify_Additional_Signers.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Identify_Additional_Signers.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Identify_Additional_Signers.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Identify_Additional_Signers.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Identify_Additional_Signers.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Identify_Additional_Signers.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Identify_Additional_Signers.htm::Title":"Identify Additional Signers","Path::contents/Identify_Additional_Signers.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Identify Additional Signers,Sign,Sign:order or notes","Path::contents/Identify_Additional_Signers.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Identify\n    Additional Signers\n  \n  \n    With the Identify Additional Signers feature, you can select other individuals that you want to sign a note or discharge summary.

Orders identified as admixtures,chemotherapy admixtures, chemotherapy syringes (continuous) and hyperals are treated as continuous orders. Other types are assumed to be administered intermittently based on the orders schedule.\n \nAdditive\nThere can be any number of additives for an order, including zero. You can enter an additive or additive synonym. If your IRM Chief/Site Manager or Application Coordinator has defined it in the IV Additives file, you may enter a quick code for an additive. The quick code allows you to predefine certain fields, thus speeding up the order entry process.\n \nStrength\nThe strength of the additive specified to be included in the order. Strength must be entered for each additive.\n \nSolution\nThere can be any number of solutions in an order, depending on the type. It is even possible to require zero solutions when an additive is premixed with a solution. If no solutions are chosen, the computer will give you a warning message, in case it is an oversight, and give you an opportunity to add one. You may enter an IV solution or IV solution synonym.\n \nVolume\nThis is the amount of the solution to be included in the order. The total volume of the order is used along with Infusion Rate to determine projected administration times for the order.\n \nInfusion Rate\nThe infusion rate is the rate at which the IV is to be administered. This value, in conjunction with the total volume of the hyperal or the admixture type, is used to determine the time covered by one bag; hence the system can predict the bags needed during a specified time of coverage. This field is free text for piggybacks. For admixtures you must enter a number that will represent the infusion rate. You can also specify the # of bags per day that will be needed. Example: 125 = 125 ml/hr (IV system will calculate bags needed per day), 125@2 = 125 ml/hr with 2 labels per day, Titrate@1 = Titrate with 1 label per day. The format of this field is either a number only or <free text > @ <Number of labels per day > (e.g., Titrate @ 1).\n \nMed Route\nThis is the route of administration for this medication (e.g., IV, SQ). If a corresponding abbreviation is found for this route in the MEDICATION ROUTES file, this module will print that abbreviation on its reports.\n \nSchedule\nThis defines the frequency the order is to be administered. Schedules may be selected from the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) or day-of-week or admin/time schedules may be used. Inpatient Medications recognizes schedules in the following formats:\n·      QxH - Hourly schedules where x is the number of hours between administrations\n·      QxD - Daily schedules where x is the number of days between administrations\n·      QxM - Monthly schedules where x is the number of months between administrations\n \nIf a schedule is defined for the Orderable Item selected when entering a new order, that schedule is displayed as the default for the order.\n \nAdministration Times\nThis defines the time(s) of day the order is to be given. If the schedule for the order contains \"PRN\" any administration times for the order will be ignored. In new order entry, the default administration times are determined as described below:\nIf administration times are defined for the Orderable Item selected, they will be shown as the default for the order.\nIf administration times are defined in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) for the patient's ward and the order's schedule, they will be shown as the default for the order.\nIf administration times are defined for the Schedule, they will be shown as the default for the order.\n \nRemarks\nThis contains additional information about the order that is not to be included on the IV or MAR labels.\n \nOther Print\nThis data is included on the IV and MAR labels.\n \nStart Date\nThe default start date/time for the order is calculated based on the DEFAULT START DATE CALCULATION field (#.05) of the INPATIENT WARD PARAMETERS file (#59.6). This allows the site to use the next or closest administration or delivery time, or the order's login date/time as the default start date/time. For continuous IV orders the default start date/time is based on the delivery times for the IV room specified. For intermittent IV orders this default is based on the order's administration times.\n \nStop Date\nThe default stop date/time for the order is determined by the <IV TYPE> GOOD FOR HOW MANY DAYS fields in the IV ROOM file (#59.5), where <IV TYPE> is piggyback, admixture, syringe, chemotherapy, etc. If the NUMBER OF DAYS FOR IV ORDER field (#3) of the IV ADDITIVES file (#52.6) is less then it will be used instead.\n \nProvider\nThis identifies the provider who authorized the order. Only users identified as providers who are authorized to write medication orders may be selected.\n \nNature Of Order\nThis specifies how the order originated. An order can be specified as written on the chart, telephoned, or verbal. This data is stored and displayed through OE/RR.\n \nOn Call\nOnly active orders may be placed on call. Orders placed on call will continue to show under the active heading of the profile until it is taken off call. An entry is placed in the order's activity log recording the person who took the action and when it was taken.\n\n\n","Path::contents/Inserting_Template_Fields_into_a_Template.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Inserting_Template_Fields_into_a_Template.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Document_Templates_(overview).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Inserting_Template_Fields_into_a_Template.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Document_Templates_(overview).htm"},{"origLink":"Document_Templates_(overview).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Inserting_Template_Fields_into_a_Template.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Document_Templates_(overview).htm"}],"Path::contents/Inserting_Template_Fields_into_a_Template.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Inserting_Template_Fields_into_a_Template.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Inserting_Template_Fields_into_a_Template.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Inserting_Template_Fields_into_a_Template.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Inserting_Template_Fields_into_a_Template.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Inserting_Template_Fields_into_a_Template.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Inserting_Template_Fields_into_a_Template.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Inserting_Template_Fields_into_a_Template.htm::Title":"Inserting Template Fields into a Template","Path::contents/Inserting_Template_Fields_into_a_Template.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Screen reader start and stop codes,Start,Start:code,Stop,Stop:code for readers","Path::contents/Inserting_Template_Fields_into_a_Template.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Inserting Template Fields into a Template\n  \n  \n    Once you have decided which Template fields to use or you have defined the Template\n    Field that you need, you can add them into a template.

The screen reader will stop when it gets to a control, such a drop-down box or some other item. These codes will allow the users who create templates at the sites to control when the screen reader needs to stop and when it would be better for it to continue. For example, if in the template, the user needs to enter a number, but some explanatory text after the number is needed, the Screen reader Continue Code will enable the template creator to make the screen reader continue reading to give the visually impaired user all the information he or she needs.\n    Another example would be some text that normally would not be read until a button received focus.\n  \n  \n    These codes enable template creators to more tightly control what is read when the screen reader is running.

There will be no requirement to update existing entries because the diagnosis codes will reflect the coding system that existed when the diagnosis was entered.\n  Diagnosis codes on the Problem List will primarily be SNOMED-CT codes, but will show ICD-10 or ICD-9 codes also, if they apply.\n   \n  Identifying Which Coding System Is Displaying\n  Because there will be the possibility of several types of codes being visible in CPRS, each code will be followed by text stating what coding system is being displayed:\n  \n    SNOMED-CT or Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine concept terms: Codes in the SNOMED-CT display with the Short Description (Coding system code). For example, Keratinous cyst (SCT 419603000)\n    ICD-9-CMor International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision Clinical Modification: The text format will be something like the following: Short Description (coding system code). For example, ILIAC (ICD-9-CM 451.81).\n    ICD-10-CM or International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision Clinical Modification: The text format will be something like the following: Short Description (coding system code). For example, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ICD-10-CM G12.21).\n  \n   \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ICD-9-CM\n        \n        \n          ICD-10-CM\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          3-5 characters in length\n        \n        \n          3-7 characters in length\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          1st character is numeric (chapters 1-17) or alphabetic (E or V for supplemental chapters)\n        \n        \n          1St character is alphabetic; 2nd character is numeric\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th characters are numeric\n        \n        \n          Characters 3-7 are alphabetic or numeric (alphabetic characters are not case sensitive)\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Decimal after first three characters\n        \n        \n          Decimal after 3rd character\n        \n      \n    \n  \n   \n  Users will see changes in the areas where ICD-9-CM codes were used previously:\n  \n    Cover Sheet– Under the Active Problems pane, users will see problems with SNOMED and ICD-9-CM codes. ICD-10-CM codes do not appear on the Problem List, except in the detailed view of a problem.\n    Problem List– On the Problem List tab’s list and detailed views\n    On the Encounter form’s Diagnosis tab – On the Diagnosis tab of the Encounter form, users now select diagnosis codes from the ICD-10-CM code set.\n    Consults tab– When selecting a provisional diagnosis, the user will use ICD-10-CM.\n    Reminder dialogs– When dialog are constructed to include the addition of codes, those codes will now use ICD-10-CM codes.\n  \n   \n   \n  Identifying Inactive Codes in CPRS\n  \n    Code set versioning (CSV) modifies VistA to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA) stipulations that diagnostic and procedure codes used for billing purposes must be the codes that were applicable at the time the service\n    was provided. Because the codes change, CPRS currently checks ICD and CPT code validity as of a specified date when codes are entered, when a new code set is implemented, and whenever Clinical Application Coordinators (CACs) or IRM personnel choose to run\n    the option.\n  \n  \n    CPRS GUI users will see indicators for inactive codes on the Cover Sheet, Problems tab, Encounter form, and in Clinical Reminders (although the Clinical Reminders changes may be less apparent).\n  \n  \n    In these GUI locations, any diagnosis or procedure codes that are inactive or will become inactive by a specified date because a new code set has been installed display with the \"#\" symbol in front of them as shown in the following examples.\n  \n  \n    Cover Sheet Displays\n  \n  \n    On the Cover Sheet, the active problems display. Users can quickly see if the patient has any inactive codes for the active problems. The \"#\"\n    symbol shows the user that this active problem has an inactive code.\n  \n  \n    If the user tries to get a detailed display of the problem, the user first gets a warning about the inactive code.\n  \n  \n    The warning message instructs the user to correct the inactive code from the Problems tab. When the user closes the warning dialog, the detailed display then comes up. The \"#\" symbol in the detailed display also shows that the\n    code is inactive.\n  \n  \n    Problems Tab Display\n  \n  \n    On the Problems tab, users are alerted to inactive codes in two ways. The first time the user goes to the Problems tab if there are problems with inactive codes, a dialog displays that tells how many problems with inactive codes have been found.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n     \n      \n    This dialog appears only the first time the user goes to the problems tab for that patient in a session. When the user closes the dialog, the Problems tab display. Problems with inactive codes have the \"#\" symbol in\n    the status column.\n  \n   \n  \n    The detailed display of a problem also indicates that the current code is inactive. Users should use the Change feature to associate the problem with an active code.\n  \n  \n    Encounter Form Display\n  \n  \n    The Diagnoses tab of the Encounter dialog displays a \"#\" next to the code if the code is inactive.\n  \n  \n    If the user tries to select that diagnosis the following warning displays that tells users about \n    codes that need to be updated through the Problems tab.\n  \n   \n  \n    Consults Tab Display\n  \n  \n    For Consults and Procedures, only active codes will be allowed for the following functions:\n  \n  \n    \n      Lexicon look up for provisional diagnosis as of the ordering date\n    \n    \n      \n        Copying or changing existing orders (the consult or procedure will not be accepted until a\n        valid code is selected)\n      \n    \n    \n      Edit/Resubmit, the original code will be checked to see if it is active, if it is inactive an active code will need to be entered before CPRS will accept it\n    \n  \n   \n  \n    Clinical Reminders\n  \n  CPRS GUI will only display codes that were active in the reminder date range.\n   \n\n","Path::contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Personal_Preferences_(Tools___Options).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Personal_Preferences_(Tools___Options).htm"},{"origLink":"General_tab_(Tools___Options).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/General_tab_(Tools___Options).htm"},{"origLink":"General_tab_(Tools___Options).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/General_tab_(Tools___Options).htm"},{"origLink":"Order_Checks_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Order_Checks_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm"},{"origLink":"Notes_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Notes_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm"},{"origLink":"Reports_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Reports_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm"},{"origLink":"Graphs_Tab_Tools_Options_.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Graphs_Tab_Tools_Options_.htm"}],"Path::contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::Title":"Lists/Teams Tab (Tools | Options)","Path::contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Date,Date:range,list:personal patient and team,Order Checking:removing non-mandatory checks,Patient:selection (opening a record),Personal,Personal:diagnosis list,Personal:lists,Personal:Preferences: Lists/Teams,source combination,Team/Lists,Team/Lists:patient selection defaults,Team/Lists:personal lists,Team/Lists:source combinations,Team/Lists:team information,Tools | Options:list/teams patient selection defaults","Path::contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Lists/Teams Tab (Tools | Options)\n  \n  \n    The Lists/Teams tab allows you to set defaults for selecting patients.

CPRS, Outpatient Pharmacy, and Inpatient Medications developers have made changes that enable users to enter this information into the medical record so that providers have a better picture of the medications the patient is taking and that order checks against these medications can occur.\n  \n   \n  \n    Making Non-VA Meds Availa\n    ble for Entry\n  \n  \n    For users to be able to enter these medications through CPRS, they must be in the CPRS Orderable Items file so that they appear when the user chooses the new order sheet. The Pharmacy patch (PSS*1.0*68) enables sites to mark items\n    as Non-VA Medications. Initially, all Pharmacy orderable items that are marked as \"outpatient\" and are not supply items will be automatically made Non-VA medications. Subsequently, Pharmacy coordinators can use the Pharmacy option Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRU\n    G\n    ENTER/EDIT] to identify items as Non-VA Meds or remove the designation.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n           For more information about how to get Non-VA Medications added to the appropriate file, please see \"Section 5.1: Communicating New Non-VA Meds Entries to the Pharmacist\" in the\n    Herbal/OTC/Non-VA Meds Documentation Release Notes\n    that will be located on the VistA Documentation Library at\n    http://www.domain/vdl\n    under the Outpatient Pharmacy listings.\n  \n   \n  \n    Items identified as \"Non-VA Meds\" are copied into the CPRS Orderable Items file when the Order Entry patch (OR*3.0*176) is installed at your site. Then, when CPRS GUI version 24 is installed, the item \"Meds, Non-VA\" is added under the Write Orders pane on\n    the Orders tab. When the user selects the Meds, Non-VA option, the dialog displays the items that were marked as Non-VA Meds and copied into the CPRS Orderable Items file.\n  \n   \n  \n    Different from Ordering Medications\n  \n  \n    Remember that entering Non-VA Medications is no\n    t the same as placing orders. Users simply enter information to provide a more complete view of what the patient is taking. However, once the items are available in the CPRS Orderable Items file, the process for entering Non-VA Medications is similar to e\n    n\n    tering other orders, but there are a few differences:\n  \n  \n    ·      Almost any CPRS user can enter Non-VA medication information. However, sites can restrict access for those holding the OREMAS key by using the OR OREMAS NON-VA MEDS parameter. For more information about this parameter, please see the\n    CPRS Technical Manual: GUI Version\n    .\n  \n  ·      Users can enter Non-VA medication even if they only have partial information.

Clinical events, such as a critical lab value or a change in orders trigger a notification to be sent to all recipients identified by the triggering package (such as Lab, CPRS, or Radiology). The notifications are located at the bottom of the Patient Selection screen.\n  There are two different listings for Notifications, Provider-centric and patient-centric. Provider-centric notifications are shown on the Patient selection screen and all pertain to the user that is logged in. For Patient-centric notifications or alerts, the user selects the View Patient Notifications under the File menu to bring them up  in their own dialog box.\n  \n    Provider-centric: The listing on the Patient Selection screen shows all notifications for the provider\n    \n      \n      This capture shows the Provider-centric view of Notifications on the Patient Selection screen.\n    \n    Patient-Centric: This listing reached by selecting File | View Patient’s Notifications…. The main difference is that all notifications listed in this dialog relate to the current patient only.   \n  \n  \n  This screen capture shows how to bring up the Patient-Centric Notifications using File | View Patient's Notifications\n   \n  \n  \n  \n  \n    After a patient is selected, the user can view all notifications for the selected patient. New columns include “My To Do” and the “Ordering Provider” and the user can process, defer, or close the dialog. The date range of displayed alerts is also customizable. \n  \n   \n  Action, Informational, and Long Text Informational Alerts\n  \n    \n      Action alerts: When you process notifications that require an action, such as signing an order, CPRS brings up the chart tab and the specific item (such as a note requiring a signature) that requires action.\n    \n    \n       Informational alerts: CPRS places an “I” before “information-only” notifications. Once you view (process) information-only notifications, CPRS deletes them.\n    \n    \n      Long Text Information alerts: CPRS places an “L” before a long alert. Long alerts have more text than will fit on one line as alerts are normally displayed. Processing the alert will bring up a dialog with additional actions.\n    \n  \n  Action Alerts Require User Interaction\n  For action alerts, users can select the alert and CPRS will take them to the appropriate tab to complete the action. This may be to view a lab result, sign orders or notes, respond to System for Mammogram Results Tracking (SMART) notifications, etc.\n   \n  SMART notifications are new with CPRS v31b. When users process a SMART notification, they are taken to a progress note title containing a Reminder dialog for them to complete.\n   \n  From the main listing, users can also Remove, Renew, Forward or Defer notifications.\n  \n    \n      \n          Removing\n          notifications is the same as deleting them. A new parameter (ORB REMOVE) enables your site to identify which notifications can be removed without processing.\n        \n    \n    \n      \n        Renewing\n        notifications is useful when a user is processing a view alert, such as an abnormal lab result, and decides that the alert should not go away after the user views it. In this case, the user can renew the alert and it will still be there the next time the user logs in to CPRS.\n      \n    \n    \n      \n         \n        Forwarding\n        notifications enables users to send an alert to someone else at the\n        site. The user can choose from the list of names that is in your site's New Person file.\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Deferring notifications enables a user to defer acting on a notification, but the notification will again display in 14 days. Users can defer notifications as many times as they choose until the system removes them.\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    Note\n    :      As a default, all Notifications are disabled. Information Resources Management (IRM) staff and Clinical Coordinators enable specific notifications by setting site parameters through the Notifications Management Menus in the List Manager version of CPRS. These specific Notifications are initially sent to all users. Users can then disable unwanted Notifications as desired, through List Manager's Personal Preferences. Some notifications are mandatory and cannot be disabled.\n  \n   \n  \n    Notifications are retained for a predetermined amount of time (up to 30 days), after which they may be sent to another destination, such as your MailMan surrogate or your supervisor. Confer with your clinical coordinator to establish and set up these options. You can also confer with your clinical coordinator to select what types of notifications you will receive. Some notifications are mandatory, however, and cannot be disabled.\n  \n  \n    Clinical Notifications are displayed on the bottom of the Patient Selection screen when you log in to CPRS. Only notifications for\n    your\n    patients or notifications that have been forwarded to you are shown.\n  \n   \n  \n    Related Topics\n  \n  \n      Sorting Notifications and Viewing Comments of\n      Forwarded Alerts\n    \n  \n      Removing Notifications\n    \n  \n      Processing Notifications\n    \n  Forwarding Notifications\n  \n      Deferring Notifications\n    \n   \n\n","Path::contents/OK_button.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/cprswt.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/OK_button.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/cprswt.css"}],"Path::contents/OK_button.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/OK_button.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/OK_button.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/OK_button.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/OK_button.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/OK_button.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/OK_button.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/OK_button.htm::Title":"OK button","Path::contents/OK_button.htm::InnerText":"\nThis will save all changes made on any of the tabbed sheets and exit.

If they meet the criteria, an electronic message is sent to the ordering provider to alert the provider to a potential problem (such as creatinine clearance, polypharmacy, duplicate order, drug-lab interaction, etc.). The provider can then choose to cancel the order or override the order check and place the order.\n  \n  \n    The Order Checking system gives users and clinical application coordinators (CACs) some flexibility to determine which order checks and notifications are sent and whether the provider must enter a reason to override the order check. To accomplish this, CPRS includes several prepackaged order checks as well as three menus for setting Order Checking parameters such as enabling and disabling specific order checks. Order Checks can also be configured to be mandatory by the Clinical Coordinator or IRM. If this feature is enabled, users cannot indicate that they do not want to receive individual order checks. Non-mandatory order checks can be enabled or disabled through the\n    Tools | Options\n    menu.\n  \n  \n    CPRS calls for order checks on all orders.

Those with High Clinical Danger Level items are displayed first, labeled as high danger, and colored blue. To accept these orders, the clinician must enter an override reason to justify accepting the order.\n  \n  \n    Whether the order check requires\n    the clinician to enter a justification depends of how each site has set the Clinical Danger Level for each order check. For example, the Pharmacy package determines if an interaction is critical or significant. Each site then determines whether the provider must enter a reason for override by setting a Clinical Danger Level in CPRS for the Critical Drug Interaction and Significant Drug Interaction order checks.\n  \n  \n    Another example would be allergy assessments. If the site has the No Allergy Assessment order c\n    heck set Clinical Danger Level to High and the patient does not have an allergy assessment, then the order will require a justification for override. If the site has the Clinical Danger Level to Moderate, no reason is required.\n  \n  \n    When a user enters a high clinical danger level override reason, the reason for override is sent with the orders to ancillary packages so that the information is available to their users.\n  \n  \n    The new dialog also has a See Monograph button. The button will not be active until after the\n    release of the first portion of the Pharmacy Reengineering project. Selecting the See Monograph button will send the user to a monograph about the drug or drug class to help the provider with additional information. If there are more than one kind of drug,\n    the Monographs for Order Checks dialog will displays a drop-down list with the choices for the various kinds of medications.\n  \n   \n  \n    Related topics\n  \n  Order Checking Overview\n  Site-Defined Clinical Reminder Order Checks\n  Order Checking Remote\n  Ordering a Diet\n  Ordering Inpatient Medications (Simple Dose)\n  Ordering Inpatient Medications (Complex Dose)\n  Ordering Outpatient Medications (Simple Dose)\n  Ordering Outpatient Medications (Complex Dose)\n  Ordering IV Fluids\n  Ordering Lab Tests\n  Ordering Radiology and Imaging Procedures\n  Ordering a Consult\n  Ordering Vitals\n  Text Only Orders\n  Event-Delayed Orders\n\n","Path::contents/Order_Checks_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Order_Checks_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Personal_Preferences_(Tools___Options).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Order_Checks_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Personal_Preferences_(Tools___Options).htm"},{"origLink":"General_tab_(Tools___Options).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Order_Checks_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/General_tab_(Tools___Options).htm"},{"origLink":"General_tab_(Tools___Options).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Order_Checks_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/General_tab_(Tools___Options).htm"},{"origLink":"Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Order_Checks_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm"},{"origLink":"Notes_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Order_Checks_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Notes_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm"},{"origLink":"Reports_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Order_Checks_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Reports_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm"},{"origLink":"Graphs_Tab_Tools_Options_.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Order_Checks_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Graphs_Tab_Tools_Options_.htm"}],"Path::contents/Order_Checks_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Order_Checks_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Order_Checks_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Order_Checks_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Order_Checks_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Order_Checks_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Order_Checks_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Order_Checks_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::Title":"Order Checks Tab (Tools | Options)","Path::contents/Order_Checks_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Order Checking,Personal,Personal:Preferences: Order Checks","Path::contents/Order_Checks_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Order Checks Tab (Tools | Options)\n  \n  \n    Select the check box next to any order check to enable or disable it.

checks,Health:Health Data Repository or HDR","Path::contents/Order_Checking_Remote.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Remote Order Checking\n  \n  \n    In addition, with the Remote Data Interoperability (RDI) project, it is now possible to perform a limited number of order checks against remote outpatient pharmacy and allergy information from other Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities that is stored in the Health Data Repository (HDR). Another project, the Clinical Health Data Repository (CHDR) will enable remote order checks against allergies and outpatient medication data from Department of Defense (DoD) facility data that is stored in the HDR. The CHDR data only relates to active dual consumers (patients that are seen at both VHA and DoD facilities).\n  \n  \n    For the selected p\n    atient, RDI requests from the HDR all outpatient pharmacy data with an expiration or discontinued date starting 30 days in the past and going forward, including into the future.\n  \n  \n    What Remote Order Checks Are Available?\n  \n  \n    With RDI and CHDR, the following order\n    checks occur:\n  \n  ·      Allergy Contrast Media Interaction\n  ·      Allergy-Drug Interaction\n  ·      Critical Drug Interaction\n  ·      Duplicate Drug Class Order\n  ·      Duplicate Drug Order\n  ·      Significant Drug Interaction \n   \n  \n    Which Items Are NOT Used in Remote Order Checks?\n  \n  \n    Some items are not used in remote order checking because they are not stored in the HDR. Others have a high annoyance factor and therefore were not included at the request of field sites. The following items are not included in remote order checks:\n  \n  ·      Inpatient Medications\n  ·      Non-VA Meds\n  ·      Supply items\n  ·      Local drugs that are not matched to the National Drug File \n  \n    Note:\n     \n           \n    \n    The HDR-Hx and HDR-IMS contain prescriptions with drugs that are not matched to the National Drug File (NDF). This prescription data should be\n    used in remote order checking for duplicate drug classes.\n    Because the National Drug File is updated regularly, these missing order checks could be resolved whenever the NDF is updated. Some drugs may never be matched, especially drugs used in research\n    .\n  \n   \n  \n    W\n    ill the Display Change?\n  \n  \n    With RDI, if an order check finds a problem, CPRS displays the information to the user. The dialog is the same one that CPRS users are accustomed to with the addition of some additional information:\n  \n  \n    ·      Medication orders include the\n    last refill date and the quantity.\n  \n  ·      Remote medication order checks also display the facility name where the medication was prescribed. The facility information is provided as a convenience should the user need to get further information from the facility. Local medication order checks do not have any text where the facility name would be.\n  ·      For allergies, the facility name where the allergy was recorded, reactant, signs, and symptoms are shown.\n  ·      Allergies are sorted in the following manner:\n  \n    Allergies are sorted by clinical danger level\n    In cases where allergy severity and symptoms are identical in one or more order checks, a single consolidated order check will display to the user. The sort order hierarchy is:\n    \n      \n        first by Severity (Highest to Lowest)\n        second by Causative Agent\n        last by Local and Remote locations\n      \n    \n  \n   \n  \n    Examples of the order check screen with remote facility names in the order checks are shown below.\n  \n  \n  \n    This screen capture shows sample order checks. At the end of possible interactions, CPRS displays the remote medication order’s location and for allergies, displays the allergy’s location. In this example, “4th Medical Group” denotes a DoD medical facility and “Cleveland” is a remote VAMC.\n  \n   \n  \n  This screen capture shows a duplicate therapy warning, a general dosing check, and a message that the daily dose range check could not be performed because of missing data.\n   \n  \n  This screen capture shows sample order checks. Red boxes have been added to show where CPRS displays the remote medication order’s location, in this case a Department of Defense medical facility. The red boxes are for emphasis and do not display in CPRS. In this example, “4th Medical Group” denotes a DoD medical facility. Order checks also indicate if a monograph is available that contains additional information.\n   \n  \n    To ensure that providers have the information they need, CPRS also provides the message \"Remote Order Checking not available--\n    checks done on local data only\" if CPRS cannot communicate with remote sources.\n  \n  \n  \n    If CPRS receives no data from the HDR, it indicates this in the message to the provider. The box and arrow are added here to show how the message will display.\n  \n   \n  \n    CPRS shows this message once during an ordering session when\n    it cannot communicate with the HDR and then does not show it again until the user begins another ordering session. However, after displaying the message, CPRS continues to attempt communication with the HDR. If CPRS reaches the HDR, remote order checks w\n    i\n    ll display when orders are placed.\n  \n   \n  \n    How Is RDI Remote Order Checking Enabled?\n  \n  \n    To use remote order checking, your site must enable a parameter to access HDR data. This parameter is set for the entire facility.\n  \n  \n    When Does CPRS Get Remote Data?\n  \n  \n    Order checks fr\n    om CPRS can happen several times during a CPRS ordering session:\n  \n  \n    ·      Beginning to write/copy/change orders -  When a user selects an order menu to begin writing orders, CPRS requests some order checks, such as polypharmacy, renal function, or creatinine clearance, for example.\n  \n  \n    ·      On order acceptance  - When the user selects Accept, CPRS requests the order checks.\n  \n  \n    ·      Signature of orders - When a user signs the order, CPRS requests order checks.\n  \n   \n  \n    How Long Is the Data Used?\n  \n  A parameter that sites can set controls how long HDR data is stored locally and is considered \"fresh\" and can be used for order checks before the data will be retrieved again from the HDR. The default time for this parameter is 120 minutes or two hours, but each site can change the time in that parameter.\n   \n  \n    Related topics\n  \n  Order Checking Overview\n  Site-Defined Clinical Reminder Order Checks\n  Order Checking Local\n  Ordering a Diet\n  Ordering Inpatient Medications (Simple Dose)\n  Ordering Inpatient Medications (Complex Dose)\n  Ordering Outpatient Medications (Simple Dose)\n  Ordering Outpatient Medications (Complex Dose)\n  Ordering IV Fluids\n  Ordering Lab Tests\n  Ordering Radiology and Imaging Procedures\n  Ordering a Consult\n  Ordering Vitals\n  Text Only Orders\n  Event-Delayed Orders\n   \n\n","Path::contents/Order_Sets.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Order_Sets.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"}],"Path::contents/Order_Sets.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Order_Sets.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Order_Sets.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Order_Sets.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Order_Sets.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Order_Sets.htm::Bookmarks":[{"id":"A2X198X","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"A2X198X"},{"id":"HRXZC8","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"HRXZC8"},{"id":"BMX2IPW","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"BMX2IPW"},{"id":"NCU1YK","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"NCU1YK"}],"Path::contents/Order_Sets.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Order_Sets.htm::Title":"Order Sets","Path::contents/Order_Sets.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Menus:on Order Sets,Order Sets","Path::contents/Order_Sets.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Order Sets\n  \n  \n    An order set is a group of quick orders that require a minimum number of prompts.

The following changes have been made:\n   \n  and the NPO diet remains intact.\n   \n  \n    \n      The NPO orderable item will be added to the Auto-DC Rules with the CPRS v31b installation. With this change, the auto-DC rules will prevent the discontinuation of the NPO diet orders for the following event types:\n      \n        \n          Specialty transfer (S)\n        \n        \n          OR (O)\n        \n        \n          Transfer (T)\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      When NPO diet orders are attempted to be manually discontinued,CPRS prevents that action from being taken and displays the dialog box to the user with text “NPO Diet cannot be discontinued”.\n    \n    \n      CPRS disallows all diet orders to have an Expiration Date/Time when ordered and prevent automatic reinstatement of a previous diet. If a new diet order is desired, a new diet must be ordered to replace the active diet order.\n    \n    \n      When ordering NPO, if a patient is currently on tube-feeding, the provider is displayed the dialog box “The patient  currently has an active tubefeeding order <display the current tube-feeding order here>“.\n    \n    \n      The Cancel Future Order Prompt from the tubefeeding order dialog has been removed. A conversion routine has been created to remove the prompt from any Quick Order. Additionally, Quick Orders will no longer allow the features of Auto Accept or Verify.\n    \n    \n      Accepting a tubefeeding order will prompt one of two different messages depending on the current diet status of the patient. If there is no existing order, the user will be prompted to enter a new diet order. If an existing diet order is present, the user will be prompted to keep the current diet or enter a new diet order.\n    \n  \n  How Discharge Affects Diet Orders\n  The Nutrition and Food Service (N&FS) VistA package manages all diet-related order processing. The auto-discontinue process cannot discontinue active diet orders.\n  If the diet is to be replaced, then a new diet should be ordered. \n  Also, the rules for auto-discontinuing (auto-dc) orders can be affected by how different VistA packages handle discontinuing and how the package communicates with CPRS. Depending on the set up and parameters, the results may be different that a user might expect.\n   Note:     If discharging/readmitting patients the Nutrition & Food Service package will auto-dc diet orders upon discharge.

The location of the Diagnostic Tests and Blood Components areas might be switched at different sites because this can be configured at each site. Note that the Date/Time Wanted applies to all components.\n  \n   \n  \n    5.     Select the needed blood component from the drop-down list. (When the user selects a blood component or a diagnostic test, the quick order field is no longer displayed).\n  \n  \n    Note:     \n     For some blood components, a message may appear under the Diagnostic Test drop-down list indicating that a diagnostic test, such as a type and screen, is needed. However, you may want to complete all of the fields for the blood component first. Otherwise, you will have to switch back to fill out the needed fields. Also, if there are\n    lab results, they will now be on the Lab Results Available tab.\n  \n   \n  \n    6.     Enter the quantity.\n  \n  \n    7.     (Optional) Select a modifier from the list if needed.\n  \n  \n    8.     Indicate when the blood product is needed by accepting the default of Now, typing in date or using the calendar control (the button with three dots) to select a date and time.\n  \n  \n    9.     Select the urgency from the drop-down list.\n  \n  \n    10.   If you select Pre-Op, you must select a surgery from the drop-down list.\n  \n  \n    11.   If you select Pre-Op and choose a surgery, the Reason for Request field is automatically populated with the surgery.

These orders must be placed from a clinic location. CPRS will ask you to confirm that you are placing a Clinic Medication order. You will also have to change the encounter location to an appropriate clinic. For outpatients, you will be prompted if no encounter location has been defined yet and then asked to confirm that you want to order Clinic Medications. For inpatients, you will be asked to confirm that you want to order Clinic Medications first and then prompted for an appropriate clinic location.\nIn a complex dose order, the user must define specific characteristics for the order. Because the dose can affect the quantity, for example, changing certain fields may cause the quantity field to either recalculate or reset to zero to force the user to enter the quantity.\nTo order complex Clinic Medication orders, use the following steps:\n\nSelect the Orders tab.\nFrom the Write Orders pane, select Clinic Medications.\nNote:   Depending on how menus are set up at your particular site, you may need to select a different option from the Write Orders pane. Many sites have customized the items in the Write Orders pane. Check with your CAC (or the person who manages information resources at your site) if you have trouble locating the Clinic Medications item.\nNote:  The following prompts will be slightly different based on the patient’s location. You will be asked to verify that you want to write Clinic Medications and to ensure that the encounter location is a clinic location\n\nIf prompted, enter the appropriate clinic for the encounter information. This will generally happen with an outpatient that does not yet have an encounter defined.\nYou can use an existing appointment if one exists or create a new one. To use Clinic Medications, you must enter a location that was previously defined clinic. If you chose a clinic location, you will see this dialog.\n\nThis dialog is to ensure that the user knows they are about to enter Clinic Medications.\n \n\nTo continue ordering Clinic Medications, select Yes and continue to the next step. To stop the Clinic Medications process, choose No.\n(Conditional) If the patient’s current location is not a clinic, you will be asked if you want to change the patient’s location.\nIn the Clinic Medications dialog, locate the medication name or quick order name in the list box by typing characters in the Medication field\nNote:  CPRS now only auto-selects (highlights in blue and places that entry in the field) a medication, dosage, route, or schedule if the user types enough characters to uniquely identify an item in the list. If the user does not enter enough characters to uniquely identify an item, CPRS waits until the user manually selects an item using the mouse or the keyboard.\n \n\n\nSelect the quick order or medication name using the mouse or keyboard.\nOnce the name is selected, CPRS displays a second dialog to select the items for the rest of the order. In the top field of the second dialog, the generic medication name and the synonym (usually a brand name) are displayed\nNote:  If the selected medication is a controlled substance that requires the signature of a provider with a DEA or VA number, the DEA# Required dialog appears. CPRS allows orders for controlled substances only when selected providers are able to sign the orders. You may need to exit the Medication Order dialog, change the provider selection, and then reenter the dialog.\n\nYou must have a DEA# or VA# to order certain medications\n \n\nSelect the Complex tab.\nNote:  After you begin a complex dose medication order, you must remain on the Complex tab until you finish the order. If you switch to the Dosage tab, CPRS clears all complex dosages and you will be forced to start again.\n \n\nSelect the Dosage field and select the appropriate dosage.\nThe dosage may not begin with a decimal, for example .5; it must begin with a numerical value, 0.5 for example. Also, the character “^” may not be entered in the Dosage field. (The associated cost is displayed to the right of the dosage.)\nNote:   CPRS now only auto-selects (highlights in blue and places that entry in the field) a medication, dosage, route, or schedule if the user types enough characters to uniquely identify an item in the list. If the user does not enter enough characters to uniquely identify an item, CPRS waits until the user manually selects an item using the mouse or the keyboard.\n \n\nEnter a Route by either selecting one from the list or typing in a valid route.\nWhen the user selects a regular schedule that does not have PRN, the administration times may display in the Schedule column. The administration times will display if they have been defined for the ward or if there is a default\n \n\nIf you selected an existing schedule, skip to step 13. If you selected OTHER, CPRS displays the Order with Schedule ‘OTHER’ dialog. Take the following steps:\n\nSelect one or more check boxes by the appropriate days of the week.\nIf the schedule requires specific administration times skip to steps c and d. To select a schedule from the list, highlight the schedule and select Add\nNote:   Users can assign either a schedule from the list or specific administration times, but not both. If launched from the Complex tab, the Day-of-Week Schedule builder does not display one-time schedules in the schedule list. Also, because the user is specifying days of the week and a schedule, the list will contain only schedules less than 24 hours (for example, Q36H will not be in the list).\n \n\nTo use a specific administration time, select the hour and minutes (if the user only selects the hour, the minutes will default to zero) and select Add\nRepeat step c until you have entered all required administration times\nWARNING:      The administration times in the Schedule field apply to each day of the week that is listed, such as TU-TH-SA@0800-2000, for example. To create a schedule such as TU@0800 TH@2000, users would have to enter two separate orders using the complex medication order dialog. Also, users may not enter a schedule that only has administration times and PRN but no days.\n \n\nIf you make a mistake while selecting an administration time or schedule, do one of the following to remove it.\n\nFor a single administration time, highlight the hour and minutes in the Set Administration Time fields and select Remove (so to remove 08:00, you would have to select that time in the Set Administration Time fields not in the Schedule text box.)\nTo remove the schedule, highlight the schedule and select Remove.\nTo remove the entire schedule and begin again with step a, select Reset\n\n\nReview the Schedule field.\nWhen you have the correct schedule, select OK.\n\nThe Order with Schedule ‘OTHER’ dialog allows you to enter a customized day-of-week and/or administration-time schedule. The user can enter specific administration times or select a schedule from the available list.\n \n\n\n\nIf necessary, select PRN.\nPRN will display in the schedule field if the PRN checkbox is checked or if the schedule is defined in the Pharmacy files as a PRN schedule\n \n\nSelect the Duration field and select the amount of time that the patient should use the specified dose.\nIn the then/and field, select the appropriate conjunction for the order.\nNote:   The conjunction “Then” requires a duration to be added.\n \n\nSelect the next row in the Dosage field and type or select a dosage.\nThe dosage may not begin with a decimal, for example .5; it must begin with a numerical value, 0.5 for example. Also, the character “^” may not be entered in the Dosage field. (The associated cost is displayed to the right of the dosage.)\n \n\nCPRS fills in the Route and Schedule fields. You can change the values in these fields if necessary.\nSelect a duration and a conjunction (then or and) except on the final row\nNote:  Your site’s IRM staff may have specified rules governing the status of inpatient medication orders when patients are transferred from one ward or service to another. It may have also specified the number of days an inpatient medication order remains active. Please check with your site’s IRM staff for information about these rules.\n \n\nRepeat steps 15-18 until you have completed the complex dose.\nNote:  You can also add or remove a row in the complex dose. To add a row, select the gray area in front of the row and select Add Row (CPRS places the new row above the selected row). To delete a row, click the gray area in front of the row you wish to delete and select Delete Row.\n \n\nAdd comments (optional).\nThe date and time that the patient is scheduled to receive the first dose of the medication appears under the Comments field. (For example, CPRS cannot show an expected first dose for “on call” or schedules with PRN. On the complex tab, it will not try to determine an expected first dose after a THEN because the first item must be completed.)\n\nIf you want the patient to receive an additional dose now, select the Give additional dose now check box. If you select the check box, the Give Additional Dose Now for Complex Order warning dialog box appears, as shown below.\n\nThis graphic shows an example of the Give Additional Dose Now for Complex Order warning.\n \nNote:   Make sure that you are careful about using give-additional-dose-now functionality. When you click the check box, CPRS creates two new orders and sends it to Inpatient Medications. Make sure the “Give additional dose now” and the regular order with the original schedule you entered do not overmedicate the patient. “Give additional dose now” is not available for ONCE, ONE-TIME, or NOW orders.

two dialogs in the ordering process and eliminates the dispense drug prompt. Inpatient medication orders now require a valid schedule. If users do not find the appropriate schedule in the list, they can choose to create a day-of-week/administration time schedule using the new Schedule builder. This feature also works for renewing, copying, and changing inpatient medication orders. The procedure for ordering medications is described below.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n          Because a valid schedule is required, if you attempt to modify an existing medication order that does not have a valid schedule, you will receive a message box stating that and will have to enter a valid schedule.\n  \n  \n    CPRS now requires a unique match in the Medication, Dosage, Route, and Schedule fields for inpatient medications before CPRS will auto-select an item from the list. For inpatient medications, the Medication\n    and Schedule fields must be an item from the list, but the Dosage and Route can be a free-text entry (the route must be in the MEDICATION ROUTES file #51.2). If the desired schedule is not on the list, the user can build a day-of-week/administration time\n    schedule using the Schedule Builder.\n  \n  \n    CPRS displays unit dose routes based on the following rules:\n  \n  \n    If a default medication route is defined in the orderable item file, CPRS displays only the default medication route for the Unit Dose orderable item in the medication route selection list.\n    If there is no default medication route defined for the orderable item, CPRS displays all possible medication routes for the dosage form to the provider for selection.\n    If there is only one possible medication route, it will be used as the default.\n    If a medication route name or its abbreviation is not included in the selection list, a user may type it in.\n  \n  \n    Also, medications that are not in the formulary display in the list with the letters \"NF\" after the name or synonym, which is also displayed. CPRS checks for non-formulary dosages (e.g., the VA formulary may not have a 2.5 MG pill, but it may have a 5.0 MG pill) and for non-formulary orderable items (e.g., the VA may not carry a specific kind of allergy medication).\n  \n   \n          New Clozapine Requirements\n         \n  \n    Select the link above to view the new requirements. CPRS now prevents the user from renewing outpatient and inpatient Clozapine orders.\n  \n   \n  \n    To write a new Inpatient Medications order, follow the\n    se steps:\n  \n  \n    Note:      If the user attempts to order inpatient medications for an inpatient from an outpatient location, CPRS discontinues the order process and returns the user to original Orders or Meds tab display.\n  \n   \n  1.     Select the Meds tab and select Action | New Medication.\n  \n    -\n    or-\n  \n  \n    Select\n    Orders\n    tab and bring up the Inpatient dialog by selecting the appropriate item under the Write Orders box.\n  \n   \n  2.      \n      Locate\n    \n    the desired medication or medication quick order.\n  \n  \n    Note:     CPRS now only auto-selects (highlights in blue and places that entry in the field) a medication, dosage, route, or schedule if the user types enough characters to uniquely identify an item in the list. If the user does not enter enough characters to uniquely identify an item, CPRS waits until the user manually selects an item using the mouse or the keyboard.\n  \n   \n  3.     Select the quick order or medication name. Once the name is selected, CPRS displays a second dialog to select the items for the rest of the order. In the top\n    field of the second dialog, the generic medication name and the synonym (usually a brand name) are displayed.\n  \n  \n    \n      T\n    he lab results for the most recent lab test associated with the selected medication are displayed in the Information field, if an associated lab test was performed within the last 365 days.\n  \n  Note:      A CAC or ADPAC will need to set the OR CPRS LAB DISPLAY ENABLED parameter to ON to activate the lab results display at a site.\n   \n  To view associated lab results for Quick Orders, a TIU OBJECT must be inserted into the Quick Order. For more information, refer to the Text Integration Utility (TIU) Clinical Coordinator & User Manual. This functionality will work for generalized Quick Orders only (orders assigned to Order Menus). It is not currently implemented for personal Quick Orders.\n   \n  The lab results functionality will not work properly for multi-divisional facilities or any sites that use different lab test names at different sites, as only one lab test name can be associated with each drug. To successfully implement this functionality, all facilities/divisions that share a VistA system must use the same name for each monitored lab test.\n   \n  \n    Note:     CPRS now uses a look up from Pharmacy to check if the selected medication is a controlled substance that will require the signature of a provider with a DEA or VA number. A message will appear to the provider \"Provider must have DEA# or VA# to order this medication\". Before an order for a controlled substance can be entered, the provider selected for the encounter must be able to sign the order. You may need to exit the dialog, change the provider, and then reenter the dialog.\n  \n   \n  \n    Click here to see the \n      inpatient medication selection dialog\n    \n    .\n  \n   \n  4.     In the Dosage field, select or type a dosage.\n  \n    The dosage may not begin with a decimal, for example .5;\n    it must begin with a numerical value, 0.5 for example. Also, the character  \"^\"  may not be entered in the Dosage field. Also, the associated cost of the drug is displayed to the right of the dosage.\n  \n   \n  \n    Note: \n        \n    CPRS now\n    only auto-selects (highlights in blue and places that entry in the field) a medication, dosage, route, or schedule if the user types enough characters to uniquely identify an item in the list. If the user does not enter enough characters to uniquely identify an item, CPRS waits until the user manually selects an item using the mouse or the keyboard.\n  \n  Once a dosage is selected, any lab test results displayed in the Information field are replaced by the National Standard Orderable Item information.\n  \n    5.\n      \n    In the\n    Route\n    field, enter the appropriate route (a default route may have been set up) by either selecting one from the list or typing in a valid route.\n  \n  \n    6.\n      \n    Select a schedule or if the schedule you want to use is not in the list, locate the Other (you can also click the Non-Standard? link and then click OK on the dialog that displays) entry and select it. If you selected Other, use these instructions to create a customized schedule\n    .\n  \n  \n    Note: \n        \n    See the \n      second inpatient Medication Order dialog for a simple dose\n    \n    .\n  \n  \n    When the user selects a schedule, the administration times may display under the \"Give additional dose now\" text. The administration times will display if they have been defined for the ward or if there is a default as long as the order is not a PRN order.\n  \n   \n  7.   If you selected an existing schedule, skip to step 8. If you selected OTHER, the Order with Schedule ‘OTHER’ dialog appears. Take the following steps:\n       a)    Select one or more checkboxes by the appropriate days of the week. \n   \n       b)    If the schedule requires specific administration times skip to steps c and d. To select a schedule from the list, highlight the schedule and select Add.  \n  Note: Users can assign either a schedule from the list or specific administration times, but not both. Also, because the user is specifying days of the week and a schedule, the list will contain only schedules less than 24 hours (for example, Q36H will not be in the list). \n   \n       c)    To use a specific administration time, select the hour and minutes (if the user only selects the hour, the minutes will default to zero) and select Add. \n       d)    Repeat step c until you have entered all required administration times. \n      Warning: The administration times in the Schedule field apply to each day of the week that is listed, such as TU-TH-SA@08002000, for example. To create a schedule such as TU@0800 TH@2000, users would have to enter two separate orders using the complex medication order dialog. Also, users may not enter a schedule that only has administration times and PRN but no days. \n   \n       e)    If you make a mistake while selecting an administration time or schedule, do one of the following to remove it: \n  \n          For a single administration time, highlight the hour and minutes in the Set Administration Time fields and select Remove (so to remove 08:00, you would have to select that time in the Set Administration Time fields not in the Schedule text box.) \n          To remove the schedule, highlight the schedule and select Remove.  \n          To remove the entire schedule and begin again with step a, select Reset. \n  \n   \n       f)    Review the Schedule field.  \n       g)    When you have the correct schedule, select OK. \n   \n  8.     Select PRN if necessary.\n  9.     Add comments (optional).\n  \n    10. CPRS displays the date and time of the expected first dose if it can determine one. (For example, CPRS cannot show an expected first dose for \"on call\" or schedules with PRN. On the complex tab, it will not try to determine an expected first dose after a THEN because the first item must be completed.) If you want to give an additional dose now, select to place a check in the \"Give additional dose now\" check box.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n      Make sure the \"Give additional dose now\" and the regular order with the original schedule you entered do not overmedicate the patient. \"Give additional dose now\" is not available for ONCE, ONE-TIME, or NOW orders. It is also not available for delayed orders.\n  \n       When you select the Give additional dose now check box, CPRS creates two new orders. Depending on your version of CPRS, the order priority and dosing schedule may be set automatically or may require manual adjustments. The pop-up messages displayed will also vary.\n      When running CPRS v31a\n  a.    The dosing schedule and priority are set automatically for each order. However, both the NOW order and the ongoing order are given the priority selected when creating the order. For example, if the priority ROUTINE was selected, then both orders are assigned a priority of ROUTINE.\n  b.    The administration schedule and priority for both orders are reflected in the Warning message displayed.\n   \n  When running CPRS v32a or later\n  a.    The dosing schedule and priority are set automatically for each order. The first order is scheduled for immediate administration (NOW) and is assigned the priority ASAP. The second order is given the priority ROUTINE and will be administered following the dosing schedule that you defined. A warning displays that is similar to the following example.\n          Note:   If your site does not use the priority ASAP, then an alternative priority (for example, STAT) will display in place of ASAP.\n       b.    Check the warning message to ensure that the orders you created are what you expected. If the orders are acceptable, then click OK. If not, click Cancel to clear the Give additional dose now check box. \n   \n  \n    13.   \n    \n      \n        Select the drop-down arrow and select a\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Priority\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        .\n      \n    \n  \n  \n      \n             a.    When running CPRS v31a: When Give additional dose now is selected, the Priority field for both the NOW order and the ongoing order are set to the selected priority. In the following example, both the NOW order and the ongoing order have been assigned the priority ASAP.\n      \n    \n        b.    When running CPRS v32a or later: When Give additional dose now is selected, the Priority field is automatically set to ASAP (or a site-specific alternative). If you select a value for the Priority field before you select the Give additional dose now checkbox, a message notifies you that the selected priority will be changed to the “Give additional dose now” priority settings. \n         c.    The default value of ASAP can be changed by selecting a different value from the Priority field before submitting the order. If the Priority field is empty when the order is submitted, it will revert to the default values for “Give additional dose now.” \n  \n    14.   Select\n    Accept Order\n    .\n  \n  \n    Note:\n     \n    If you do not complete the mandatory items or if the information is incorrect, CPRS sends a message that tells you that the information is incorrect and\n    shows you the correct type of response.\n  \n  \n    15.   (Conditional) If the medication ordered may be contraindicated because of allergies, drug interactions, or duplicate orders, CPRS will display the Order Check window. Carefully review all order checks and decide\n    if the medication should be ordered. Do one of the following:\n  \n  \n    o      To proceed, select Accept Order.\n  \n  o      To stop the ordering process and return to the dialog, Cancel Order.\n   \n  \n    15.   Enter another medication order\n  \n  \n    -or-\n  \n  \n    select\n    Quit\n    .\n  \n  \n    Note: \n        \n    The order must be signed\n    before it is sent to pharmacy.

Of course to order these infusions, the patient must be assigned a clinic location. Intermittent refers to an infusion order administered at scheduled intervals (Q4H, QDAY) or One-Time only, “over a specified period of time” (e.g., “Infuse over 30 min.”). For intermittent infusion orders, as the user selects a solution and/or additive, the items from that list are displayed to the right under Solution/Additive. For Intermittent infusion orders the only optional fields are the Comments, Infuse Over, and the Duration or Total Volume fields.\nHowever, for intermittent orders, the Infusion Rate field changes to the Infuse Over Time field where the user enters either a number of minutes or hours. the schedule field is not available.\nTo order intermittent Clinic Infusion orders, follow these steps:\n\nSelect the Orders tab.\nFrom the Write Orders pane, select Clinic Infusions.\nNote:   Depending on how menus are set up at your particular site, you may need to select a different option from the Write Orders pane. Many sites have customized the items in the Write Orders pane. Check with your CAC (or the person who manages information resources at your site) if you have trouble locating the Clinic Infusions item.\nNote:   The following prompts will be slightly different based on the patient’s location. You will be asked to verify that you want to write Clinic Infusions and to ensure that the encounter location is a clinic location.\n\nIf prompted, enter the appropriate clinic for the encounter information. This will generally happen with an outpatient that does not yet have an encounter defined.\nYou can use an existing appointment if one exists or create a new one. To use Clinic Infusions, you must enter a location that was previously defined clinic. If you chose a clinic location, you will see this dialog.\n\nThis dialog is to ensure that the user knows they are about to enter Clinic Infusions.\n\nTo continue ordering Clinic Medications, select Yes and continue to the next step. To stop the Clinic Medications process, choose No.\n(Conditional) If the patient’s current location is not a clinic, change the patient’s location to the appropriate clinic.\nThe Clinic Infusion Order dialog displays.\n\nThe Infusion Order dialog for continuous infusion orders does not use a schedule, but it does have an infusion rate. For\ncontinuous infusion orders, the new Additive Frequency field enables providers to indicate into which IV bag the additive\nshould be placed.\n\nSelect the needed solutions from the Solutions tab.\nSelect an additive from the list (if necessary) and edit the strength if needed. Repeat for additional additives if necessary. How users can edit the strength field will depend on the values for strength defined in the pharmacy files as follows:\nThe solution and additives you select will appear in the Solution/Additive grid.\nNote:   To remove an additive or a solution, select the solution or additive and select Remove.\n\nSelect a Route (such as intravenous, epidural, IV piggyback, etc.) If the desired route is not available, select the Other option in the list of routes to bring the expanded med route form that lists all possible IV routes.\nIn the Type drop-down box, select Intermittent.\nNote:   If you change the IV Type from Intermittent to Continuous, the Schedule field becomes unavailable (greyed out) and the Infusion over Time field becomes the Infusion Rate field.\nNote:   For a definition of Continuous and Intermittent orders, select the IV Type Help link and a message box will display with a short definition of what the terms mean.\n\nTo help providers enter the correct type of infusion order, this dialog provides\na definition of Continuous and Intermittent infusion orders.\n\nSelect a schedule from the list or create one using the Day-of-Week schedule builder.\nNote:   When a user writes an intermittent infusion order with a schedule of ONCE, the following will happen in CPRS:\n\n\n\nThe DURATION field will be disabled.\nThe Give Additional Dose Now option will be disabled.\nExpected First Dose and Administration Times will not be displayed.\n\n\n\nNote:   When a user writes an intermittent infusion order with a schedule of On Call or a PRN, the following will happen in CPRS:\n\n\n\nExpected First Dose and Administration Times will not be displayed.\n\n\n\n\nIf you selected an existing schedule, skip to step 14. If you selected OTHER, CPRS displays the Order with Schedule ‘OTHER’ dialog. Take the following steps:\n\nSelect one or more checkboxes by the appropriate days of the week\nIf the schedule requires specific administration times skip to steps c and d. To select a schedule from the list, highlight the schedule and select Add.\nNote:   Users can assign either a schedule from the list or specific administration times, but not both.\n\nTo use a specific administration time, select the hour and minutes (if the user only selects the hour, the minutes will default to zero) and select Add.\nRepeat step c until you have entered all required administration times.\nWarning:The administration times in the Schedule field apply to each day of the week that is listed, such as TU-TH-SA@0800-2000, for example. To create a schedule such as TU@0800 TH@2000, users would have to enter two separate orders using the complex medication order dialog. Also, users may not enter a schedule that only has administration times and PRN but no days\n\nIf you make a mistake while selecting an administration time or schedule, do one of the following to remove it:\n\nFor a single administration time, highlight the hour and minutes in the Set Administration Time fields and select Remove (so to remove 08:00, you would have to select that time in the Set Administration Time fields not in the Schedule text box.)\nTo remove the schedule, highlight the schedule and select Remove.\nTo remove the entire schedule and begin again with step a, select Reset.\n\n\nReview the Schedule field.\nWhen you have the correct schedule, select OK.\n\n\nIf necessary, select the PRN checkbox\nEnter the number for the duration over which to infuse the medication.\nMove to the next field and select the unit of time (the units can be only Minutes or Hours) over which the infusion should be given.\nFor example, you might enter 30 for the number, move to the next field, and then select minutes to define infuse over 30 minutes.\n\nSelect the Priority\nEnter a number for the duration or total volume.\nMove to the next field and select the appropriate unit (liters-L, milliliters-ml, days, hours, or doses).\nNote:   If you change the units, the value in the Duration or the Total Volume field will be removed and you will need to enter it again. This is a safety feature to insure the patient does not receive a dangerous amount of fluid.\n\nIf necessary, select the Give additional dose now checkbox.\nNote:   Make sure that you are careful about using give-additional-dose-now functionality. When you click the check box, CPRS creates two new orders and sends it to Inpatient Medications. Make sure the “Give additional dose now” and the regular order with the original schedule you entered do not overmedicate the patient. “Give additional dose now” is not available for ONCE, ONE-TIME, or NOW orders. It is also not available for delayed orders.\n\nEnter any comments (if necessary).\nReview the order text at the bottom of the dialog to ensure that it is correct.\nIf the order text is correct, select Accept Order.\nReview order check items and respond appropriately. If the order should not be entered because of a possible interaction, select Cancel. If the order is okay to accept, select Accept Order.\nTo enter additional Clinic Infusion orders, repeat steps 6-19 as needed. To finish, select Quit. For an outpatient, when you select quit, the encounter location will remain with the current clinic. For an inpatient, when you select Quit, the encounter location will go back to the location where the patient was before you began entering Clinic Infusion orders\nNote:   The order must be signed before it is sent. You can either sign the order now or wait until later.\n\n\n\nRelated Topics\nClinic Infusions (Overview)\nOrdering Continuous Clinic Infusions\nOne-Step Clinic Unit Dose Medication Administration\nOne-Step Clinic Administration for IV Medications\n \n \n\n\n","Path::contents/Ordering_Lab_Tests.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Lab_Tests.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Viewing_Laboratory_Test_Results.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Lab_Tests.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Viewing_Laboratory_Test_Results.htm"}],"Path::contents/Ordering_Lab_Tests.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Lab_Tests.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Lab_Tests.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Lab_Tests.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Lab_Tests.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Lab_Tests.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Lab_Tests.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Lab_Tests.htm::Title":"Ordering Lab Tests","Path::contents/Ordering_Lab_Tests.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Blood:gases,CBC,CBC with Diff,Chem 20,Chem 7,Collection time,Glucose,Lab tests,Lab tests:ordering,Orders,Orders:lab tests,PT/PTT,Urinalysis,New:New Admission Panel","Path::contents/Ordering_Lab_Tests.htm::InnerText":"\nOrdering Lab Tests\nTo place an order for a lab test, follow these steps:\n1.     Select the Orders tab.\n2.     Select the active orders view from the View Orders pane\n-or-\nselect View | Active Orders (includes pending, recent activity).\n \n3.     Select Lab Tests in the Write Orders list.\nNote: The lab tests order may be labeled differently or may not be available from your Write Orders field.\n \nThe Order a Lab Test dialog will appear.\nNote:     If encounter information has not been entered, the encounter information dialog will appear before the Order a Lab Test dialog.

Because the dose can affect the quantity, for example, changing certain fields may cause the quantity field to either recalculate or reset to zero to force the user to enter the quantity. \n  \n  \n    CPRS displays unit dose routes based on the following rules:\n  \n  \n    1.    If a default medication route is defined in the orderable item file, CPRS displays\n    only\n    the default medication route for the Unit Dose orderable item in the medication route selection list.\n  \n  2.   If there is no default medication route defined for the orderable item, CPRS displays all possible medication routes for the dosage form to the provider for selection.\n  3.   If there is only one possible medication route, it will be used as the default.\n  4.   If a medication route name or its abbreviation is not included in the selection list, a user may type it in.\n  Also, medications that are not in the formulary display in the list with the letters \"NF\" after the name or synonym, which is also displayed. CPRS checks for non-formulary dosages (e.g., the VA formulary may not have a 2.5 MG pill, but it may have a 5.0 MG pill) and for non-formulary orderable items (e.g., the VA may not carry a specific kind of allergy medication).\n   \n  \n      New Clozapine Requirements\n    \n  \n    Select the link above to view the new requirements. CPRS now prevents the user from renewing outpatient and inpatient Clozapine orders.\n  \n   \n  \n    To write a new Inpatient Medications order, follow these steps:\n  \n  \n    Note:\n      If the\n    user attempts to order inpatient medications for an inpatient from an outpatient location, CPRS discontinues the order process and returns the user to original Orders or Meds tab display.\n  \n  \n    In a complex dose order, the user must define specific characteristics for the order. Because the dose can affect the quantity, for example, changing certain fields may cause the quantity field to either recalculate or reset to zero to force the user to enter the quantity.\n  \n   \n  \n    1. \n     \n    Select the\n    Meds\n    tab and select\n    Action | New Medication\n    .\n  \n  \n    -or-\n  \n  \n    Select the\n    Orders\n    tab and bring up the Inpatient dialog by cl\n    icking the appropriate item under the Write Orders box.\n  \n   \n  \n    2. \n     Locate\n    the desired medication or medication quick order.\n  \n  \n    Note: \n     CPRS now only auto-selects (highlights in blue and places that entry in the field) a medication, dosage, route, or schedule if the user types enough characters to uniquely identify an item in the list. If the user does not enter enough characters to uniquely identify an item, CPRS waits until the user manually selects an item using the mouse or the keyboard.\n  \n   \n  3.   Select the quick order or medication name. Once the name is selected, CPRS displays a second dialog to select the items for the rest of the order. In the top field of the second dialog, the generic medication name and the synonym (usually a brand name) are displayed.\n  \n      The lab results\n     for the most recent lab test associated with the selected medication are displayed in the Information field, if an associated lab test was performed within the last 365 days.\n  Note:   A CAC or ADPAC will need to set the OR CPRS LAB DISPLAY ENABLED parameter to ON to activate the lab results display at a site.\n   \n  To view associated lab results for Quick Orders, a TIU OBJECT must be inserted into the Quick Order. For more information, refer to the Text Integration Utility (TIU) Clinical Coordinator & User Manual.This functionality will work for generalized Quick Orders only (orders assigned to Order Menus). It is not currently implemented for personal Quick Orders.\n   \n               The lab results functionality will not work properly for multi-divisional facilities or any sites that use different lab test names at different sites, as only one lab test name can be associated with each drug. To successfully implement this functionality, all facilities/divisions that share a VistA system must use the same name for each monitored lab test.\n  \n    Note: \n       \n    CPRS now uses a look up from Pharmacy to check if the selected medication is a controlled substance that will require the signature of a provider with a DEA or VA number. A message will appear to the provider \"Provider must have DEA# or VA# to order this medication\" as shown in the graphic below. Before an order for a controlled substance can be entered, the provider selected for the encounter must be able to sign the order. You may need to exit the dialog, change the provider, and then reenter the dialog.\n  \n  \n    Click here to see the \n      new medication selection dialog.\n    \n  \n   \n  \n    4. \n     \n    Select the\n    Complex Dose\n    tab.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n      Once you begin a complex order, you must remain on the Complex tab until you finish that order. Do not attempt to start from or switch back to the Dosage tab. If you do, all complex dosages will be erased and you will be forced to start again.\n  \n  \n    5.   In the Dosage field, select or type the appropriate dosage.\n  \n  \n    The dosage may not begin with a decimal, for example .5; it must begin with a numerical value, 0.5 for example. Also, the character  \"^\" may not be entered in the Dosage field. (The associated cost is displayed to the right of the dosage.)\n  \n  Note:   CPRS now only auto-selects (highlights in blue and places that entry in the field) a medication, dosage, route, or schedule if the user types enough characters to uniquely identify an item in the list. If the user does not enter enough characters to uniquely identify an item, CPRS waits until the user manually selects an item using the mouse or the keyboard.\n  Once a dosage is selected, any lab test results displayed in the Information field are replaced by the National Standard Orderable Item information.\n  \n    6.   In the Route field, enter the appropriate delivery route for the medication (a default route could have been set up) by either selecting one from the list or by typing a valid route.\n  \n  \n    7.    In the Schedule field, select an existing schedule from the list or, to use a day-of week/administration time schedule not on the list, select OTHER.\n  \n  \n    8.   If you entered an existing schedule, skip to step 9. If you selected OTHER, CPRS displays the Order with Schedule ‘OTHER’ dialog. Take the following steps:\n  \n       a)    Select one or more checkboxes by the appropriate days of the week. \n   \n       b)    If the schedule requires specific administration times skip to steps c and d. To select a schedule from the list, highlight the schedule and select Add.  \n  Note: Users can assign either a schedule from the list or specific administration times, but not both. Also, because the user is specifying days of the week and a schedule, the list will contain only schedules less than 24 hours (for example, Q36H will not be in the list). \n   \n       c)    To use a specific administration time, select the hour and minutes (if the user only selects the hour, the minutes will default to zero) and select Add. \n       d)    Repeat step c until you have entered all required administration times. \n      Warning: The administration times in the Schedule field apply to each day of the week that is listed, such as TU-TH-SA@08002000, for example. To create a schedule such as TU@0800 TH@2000, users would have to enter two separate orders using the complex medication order dialog. Also, users may not enter a schedule that only has administration times and PRN but no days. \n   \n       e)    If you make a mistake while selecting an administration time or schedule, do one of the following to remove it: \n       f)    Review the Schedule field.  \n       g)    When you have the correct schedule, select OK. \n  \n          For a single administration time, highlight the hour and minutes in the Set Administration Time fields and select Remove (so to remove 08:00, you would have to select that time in the Set Administration Time fields not in the Schedule text box.) \n          To remove the schedule, highlight the schedule and select Remove.  \n          To remove the entire schedule and begin again with step a, select Reset. \n  \n  \n    9.   Select PRN, if necessary.\n  \n  \n    10. Select the Duration cell and enter a number and select units (\"days\" is the default) a patient should use the specified dose.\n  \n  \n    11.   Add the appropriate conjunction: And, Then, or no conjunction for the final line.\n  \n  \n    Note:       The conjunction \"Then\" requires a duration to be added.\n  \n   \n  \n    12.   Select the Dosage field in the next row and select a dosage.\n  \n  \n    The dosage may not begin with a decimal, for example .5;\n    it must begin with a numerical value, 0.5 for example. Also, the character “^” may not be entered in the Dosage field. (The associated cost is displayed to the right of the dosage.)\n  \n   \n  \n    13.   CPRS will fill in the Route and Schedule fields. If necessary, select and change the Route and Schedule cells.\n  \n  \n    14.   Select and enter a duration and a conjunction.\n  \n  \n    Note: \n     Your site may have specified rules governing the status of inpatient medication orders when patients are transferred from one ward or service to another. It may have also specified the number of days an inpatient medication order remains active. Please check with your site's staff for information about these rules.\n  \n   \n  \n    15.   Repeat steps 12-14 until you have completed the complex dose.\n  \n  \n    Note: \n     You can also add or remove a row in the complex dosage. If you add a row, the new row will be placed above the selected row. To add a row, click the gray area in front of the row and click Add Row. To delete a row, click the gray area in front of the row to be deleted and click Delete Row.\n  \n   \n  16.   Add comments (optional).\n  \n    The date and time that the patient is scheduled to receive the first dose of the medication appears under the Comments field. (For example, CPRS cannot show an expected first dose for \"on call\" or schedules with PRN. On the complex tab, it will not try to\n    determine an expected first dose after a THEN because the first item must be completed.)\n  \n   \n  17.   CPRS displays when the first dose of the medication is expected to be given. If you want to give an additional dose now, click to place a check in the \"Give additional dose now\" check box.\n  \n    Note:\n     \n      \n    Make sure that you are careful about using give-additional-dose-now functionality. When you click the check box, CPRS creates two new orders and sends it to Inpatient Medications. Make sure the \"Give additional dose now\" and\n    the regular order with the original schedule you entered do not overmedicate the patient. \"Give additional dose now\" is not available for ONCE, ONE-TIME, or NOW orders. It is also not available for delayed orders.\n  \n   \n  \n  CPRS displays a warning to providers who select “Give additional dose now” when placing a complex order\n  When you select the Give additional dose now check box, CPRS creates two new orders. Depending on your version of CPRS, the order priority and dosing schedule may be set automatically or may require manual adjustments. The pop-up messages displayed will also vary. \n  \n    When running CPRS v32 or later: \n    The dosing schedule and priority are set automatically for each order. The first order is scheduled for immediate administration (NOW) and is assigned the priority ASAP. The second order is given the priority ROUTINE and will be administered following the dosing schedule that you defined. A warning displays that is similar to the following example. \n  \n    Note:      If your site does not use the priority ASAP, then an alternative priority (for example, STAT) will display in place of ASAP. \n  \n  \n  Warning displayed when “Give additional dose now” is selected\n  \n    18. \n    Check the warning message to ensure that the orders you created are what you expected. If the orders are acceptable, then click OK. If not, click Cancel to clear the Give additional dose now check box..\n  \n  \n    19. \n      \n    Select a\n    Priority\n    from the drop-down list.\n  \n  \n          When running CPRS v32a or later: When Give additional dose now is selected, the Priority field is automatically set to ASAP (or a site-specific alternative). If you select a value for the Priority field before you select the Give additional dose now checkbox, a message notifies you that the selected priority will be changed to the “Give additional dose now” priority settings.   \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    20. \n      \n    Select\n    Accept Order\n    .\n  \n  \n     Note:\n     \n    If you do not complete the mandatory items or if the information is incorrect, CPRS sends a message that tells you that the information is incorrect and shows you the correct type of response.\n  \n   \n  \n    21.   (Conditional) If the medication ordered may be contraindicated because of allergies, drug interactions, or duplicate orders, CPRS will display the Order Check window. Carefully review all order checks and decide if the medication should be ordered. Do one of the following:\n  \n  o     To proceed, select Accept Order.\n  o     To stop the ordering process and return to the dialog, Cancel Order.\n   \n  22.   Enter another medication order\n  \n    -or-\n  \n  \n    select\n    Quit\n    .\n  \n  \n    Note: \n    The order must be signed before it is sent to pharmacy. You can either \n      sign the order now\n    \n    or wait until later.\n  \n   \n  \n    Related Topics\n  \n  \n      Viewing Medications\n    \n  \n    Sorting the Medications View\n  \n  \n    Ordering Medications Overview\n  \n  \n      Ordering Inpatient Medications (Simple Dose)\n    \n  \n      Ordering Outpatient Medications (Simple Dose)\n    \n  \n      Ordering\n      Outpatient Medications (Complex Dose)\n    \n  \n      Change Medication Order\n    \n  \n      Discontinue Medication Order\n    \n  \n      Hold Medication Order\n    \n  \n      Renew Medication Order\n    \n  \n    Other Medication Actions (popup menu)\n  \n   \n  \n\n","Path::contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"assets/images/problem_ordering_related_med.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/problem_ordering_related_med.gif"},{"origLink":"assets/images/Clozapine_instructions_outpt_2021_04_10.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Clozapine_instructions_outpt_2021_04_10.gif"},{"origLink":"assets/images/Clozapine_instructions_inpt_2021_04_10.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Clozapine_instructions_inpt_2021_04_10.gif"},{"origLink":"Viewing_Medications.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Viewing_Medications.htm"},{"origLink":"Sorting_the_Medications_View.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Sorting_the_Medications_View.htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Inpatient_Medications.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Inpatient_Medications.htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Inpatient_Medications_Complex_Dose_.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Inpatient_Medications_Complex_Dose_.htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Outpatient_Medications_(Simple_Dose).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Medications_(Simple_Dose).htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Outpatient_Medications_(Complex_Dose).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Medications_(Complex_Dose).htm"},{"origLink":"Changing_Medication_Orders.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Changing_Medication_Orders.htm"},{"origLink":"Discontinuing_Orders.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Discontinuing_Orders.htm"},{"origLink":"Hold_Medication_Order.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Hold_Medication_Order.htm"},{"origLink":"Renew_Medication.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Renew_Medication.htm"},{"origLink":"Other_Medication_Actions.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Other_Medication_Actions.htm"}],"Path::contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm::Bookmarks":[{"id":"New_Clozapine_Requirements","tagName":"a","innerText":""}],"Path::contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm::Title":"Ordering Medications Overview","Path::contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm::Status":"Draft","Path::contents/Ordering_Medications_Overview.htm::InnerText":"\n  Ordering Medications Overview\n  Using CPRS, providers can order inpatient and outpatient medications with simple doses or complex doses. Providers can place medications orders for unit dose or infusion orders for inpatients. Also, CPRS enables providers to quickly order medications that will be given in clinics. \n   \n  There are a few items that deal with how CPRS works that providers need to be aware of when ordering medications, such as \n  \n    the need for inpatient medications to have a valid schedule, including the option to use the schedule builder\n    a possible error if there is mismatch between the CPRS order number and the pharmacy order number\n    how CPRS displays unit dose routes\n    how CPRS displays non-formulary drugs\n    requirements for Clozapine treatment\n  \n  This section then goes through how to order medications for inpatients, outpatients, and patients seen in clinic. The various sections will also include how to write medication orders for unit dose and infusion orders.\n   \n  Valid Routes for Inpatient Medications\n  Inpatient medication orders now require a valid schedule. If users do not find the appropriate schedule in the list, they can choose to create a day-of week/administration time schedule using the new Schedule Builder. This feature also works for renewing, copying, and changing inpatient medication orders. The procedure for ordering medications is described below.  \n  \n    Note:     Because a valid schedule is required, if you attempt to modify an existing medication order that does not have a valid schedule, you will receive a message box stating that and will have to enter a valid schedule.\n     \n  \n  Order Number Mismatch between CPRS and Pharmacy\n  When a user takes actions on an order, such as renewing, changing, or discontinuing it, an infrequent error sometimes occurs where the order number in CPRS and the order in Pharmacy do not match. In this case, CPRS displays a warning that there is an “invalid pharmacy order number” and instructing the user to contact someone in the Pharmacy service to complete the action.\n   \n  Rules for the Display of Unit Dose Routes in CPRS\n  CPRS displays unit dose routes based on the following rules:\n  \n    If a default medication route is defined in the orderable item file, CPRS displays only the default medication route for the Unit Dose orderable item in the medication route selection list. \n    If there is no default medication route defined for the orderable item, CPRS displays all possible medication routes for the dosage form to the provider for selection. \n    If there is only one possible medication route, it will be used as the default. \n    If a medication route name or its abbreviation is not included in the selection list, a user may type it in.\n  \n  How CPRS Designates Non-Formulary Drugs\n  Also, medications that are not in the formulary display in the list with the letters “NF” after the name or synonym, which is also displayed. CPRS checks for nonformulary dosages (e.g., the VA formulary may not have a 2.5 MG pill, but it may have a 5.0 MG pill) and for non-formulary orderable items (e.g., the VA may not carry a specific kind of allergy medication).\n   \n  New Clozapine Requirements\n  Enhanced and new functionality includes updated FDA guidelines for using ANC lab results exclusively for treating and monitoring patients taking clozapine, as shown in the following table. The new guidelines replace previous requirements which included both white blood cell (WBC) count and ANC lab results. The Mental Health software’s code replaces the WBC/ANC results combination and supports ANC values solely as the lab value of choice. \n  Note:  FDA REMS prescribed dosage and monitoring is based on the ANC value only; however, VA requires a matching WBC, indicating the WBC is from the same draw date/time as the ANC.\n   \n  FDA ANC Levels and Monitoring Guidelines\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ANC Level \n        \n        \n          ANC Monitoring \n        \n        \n          Frequency of ANC lab tests \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Normal range \n        \n        \n          ANC ≥ 1500 cmm \n        \n        \n          Weekly (W) for patients 1 – 6 months on therapy \n          Bi-weekly (B)  for patients 6 – 12 months on therapy \n          Monthly (M) for patients >12 months on therapy\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Mild neutropenia \n        \n        \n          1000 – 1499 cmm \n        \n        \n          ANC labs 3 times weekly until ANC stabilizes to 1500 cmm or greater \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Moderate neutropenia \n        \n        \n          500 – 999 cmm \n        \n        \n          ANC labs Daily until ANC stabilizes to 1000 cmm or greater, then 3 times weekly until ANC stabilizes to 1500 cmm or greater \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Severe neutropenia \n        \n        \n          < 500 cmm \n        \n        \n          ANC labs Daily until ANC stabilizes to 1000 cmm or greater, then 3 times weekly until ANC stabilizes to 1500 cmm or greater \n        \n      \n    \n  \n   \n  Note:  The ANC unit of measure is expressed as cells per cubic millimeter (cmm) which is equivalent to cu mm, mm3 or µL.  \n   \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) is lab test of choice \n           \n        \n        \n          Per the REMS document, “the WBC count is required in order to calculate the ANC; however, ANC is a more relevant indicator of drug-induced neutropenia than WBC count.”  \n          New and enhanced functionality is based on the presence of an ANC result in the last 7 days. \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          ANC less than 1000 cmm \n           \n        \n        \n          The FDA recommends that clozapine treatment be discontinued if the ANC is less than 1000 cmm; however, with correct documentation and justification by the provider, the NCCC Director has the discretion to continue treatment through a National Override. \n        \n      \n    \n  \n   \n  Note:  Recently the FDA offered continuation of clozapine when a patient’s ANC result is less than 1000 cmm. To continue clozapine in this situation, VA requires the patient to sign a special informed consent form in which the patient accepts the risks of continuation and prescriber’s clinical justification for medical review is documented by the Director of NCCC. \n  \n    The other order checks related to clozapine will continue to work as they have prior to these changes.\n   \n  Additionally, the values of the Days Supply, Quantity, and Refills fields are restricted based on the type of patient that Mental Health designates in their files when the provider is ordering clozapine. This can be a 7, 14, or 28-day recipient of the clozapine drug. For refills, the following rules apply: \n  \n    Patients on a 7-day monitoring frequency have no refills available. \n    Patients on a 14-day monitoring frequency can receive a full 14-day supply or a 7-day supply and ONE refill. \n    Patients on a 28-day monitoring frequency can receive EITHER a full 28day supply, or a 14-day supply and ONE refill, or a 7-day supply and THREE refills.   \n  \n  CPRS now prevents the user from renewing outpatient and inpatient clozapine orders. \n  \n    Note:  Clozapine orders should not be renewed and each order for clozapine should be entered as a new order. Renewal of clozapine is not allowed in CPRS from the Orders tab of the chart and renew is also blocked in the VistA Pharmacy Software. CPRS currently allows clozapine renewal from the CPRS Meds tab. This is a known issue and users should not attempt to renew orders for clozapine. \n  \n   \n  Normal ANC Results\n  The FDA defines Normal – sometimes referred to as “safe” or “passing” ANC results – as equal to or greater than 1500 cmm. When the system identifies that the ANC results are Normal and a matching WBC is present, the provider completes the prescription/order which is sent as a Pending Order to pharmacy. There are no message updates in CPRS for a Normal ANC result.  \n   \n  Mild Neutropenia\n  The FDA defines Mild neutropenia as an ANC result from 1000 to 1499 cmm. New ANC lab test monitoring guidelines for Mild neutropenia are presented to the ordering provider in a new CPRS message:  \n  \n    Test ANC labs 3x weekly until levels stabilize to greater than or equal to 1500 cmm.\n   \n  Moderate and Severe Neutropenia\n  FDA defines Moderate neutropenia as ANC 500-999 cmm and severe neutropenia as ANC less than 500 cmm. Both Moderate and Severe neutropenia require the same lab test monitoring guidelines as they are both less than 1000 cmm. A new CPRS message includes:  \n  \n    Test ANC labs daily until levels stabilize to equal to or greater than 1000 cmm, then test ANC labs 3x weekly until levels stabilize to greater than or equal to 1500 cmm. \n  \n    When there is Moderate or Severe neutropenia with a matching WBC result present, a National Override is required. If a matching WBC result is not present, the system will alert the provider that the system will address the ‘No Matching WBC’ issue first. See information on No Matching WBC.\n     \n  Moderate and Severe Neutropenia – National Override in Effect\n  When a National Override for Moderate or Severe Neutropenia has been approved by the NCCC and is in effect, modified CPRS screens display, including instructions for testing ANC.\n     \n  No ANC Results\n  The system relies on the presence of an ANC result to treat patients receiving clozapine, with exceptions as noted to override in certain conditions. The system requires an ANC within the last 7 days. \n  \n    For registered patients with a history of normal ANC results, the requirement for a normal ANC result in the last 7 days may be bypassed to meet an urgent need under special conditions.  \n  \n    In CPRS, when the provider is notified that there are no ANC results in the last seven days, they will decide based on the following:\n   \n   \n  \n       Non-emergency\n      If this is not an emergency, the provider will request a National Override to dispense the clozapine at the patient’s normal frequency. When the National Override is authorized and recorded in the local VistA system, the provider reenters the order and a Pending prescription/order to dispense clozapine at the patient’s normal frequency is sent.\n      For example, this may be used when:\n      \n        \n          The patient’s last blood test was done at another facility and isn’t in the local VistA system, but the provider has seen the results\n        \n        \n          The provider feels it is unnecessary – perhaps the patient is at end of life or some other medical condition – and there is no need to keep drawing blood \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Emergency 4-day supply – Special Conditions Local Override\n      In an emergency where a 4-day supply is needed, the provider may choose to use a Special Conditions Local Override which optionally allows a one-time 4-day emergency supply to be dispensed for specific prescriber-approved reasons.\n      Note: A written prescription or order is required. Special Conditions Local Override is not supported in CPRS – no Pending Order is available.\n    \n  \n  If the patient is an Outpatient, the prescriber-approved reason must be one of the following:\n  \n    Weather-related conditions\n    Mail order delay\n    Inpatient going on leave\n  \n  If the patient is an Inpatient, the prescriber-approved reason will be: \n  IP Order Override with Outside Lab Results\n   \n  When there is No ANC result for the last 7 days, a new CPRS screen displays notifying the provider of the missing results. The top part of the new CPRS message indicates the option to request a National Override when the condition is not an emergency and clozapine is to be dispensed at the patient’s normal frequency.\n   \n  \n   \n  If this is an emergency, the bottom part of the new CPRS message is dependent on whether this is an Outpatient or and Inpatient.\n   \n  Outpatient\n  If this is an Outpatient, the second part of the message is to instruct the provider to write a prescription and include an approved reason from the list.   \n   \n  \n   \n  Inpatient\n  If this is an Inpatient, the second part of the message is to instruct the provider to write an order and include the single approved reason – IP Order Override with Outside Lab Results.\n    \n  \n   \n  No Matching WBC (ANC Present)\n  When there is an ANC result in the last 7 days but no matching WBC, regardless of whether it is a normal result or indicates mild or moderate to severe neutropenia, the system will address the ‘No Matching WBC’ condition first. A warning message to the provider will require a National Override in order to dispense clozapine. The system can only address one condition at a time.  \n  \n    Note:  A Matching WBC result is collected at the same draw date/time as the ANC.\n  \n   \n  Emergency Registration Override\n  An Emergency Registration Override is typically warranted for the following reasons:\n  \n    The patient has a current NCCC registration at another VistA facility \n      \n        Inpatient transferred from another facility\n        Outpatient from another facility becomes an inpatient\n      \n    \n    The patient has never been registered at the local facility\n    The patient status has changed from Active to Discontinued\n    An Outpatient with a prescription that had previously been filled outside of the VA or at another VA facility arrives during NCCC non-duty hours \n  \n  Note:  A Clozapine Authorization Number is only valid for a patient at the facility where they were registered. When a Clozapine patient arrives at a new facility, they need to be re-registered with a new Clozapine Authorization Number before the facility’s CPRS and Pharmacy applications will allow a Clozapine order to be processed. \n  \n    If the patient is not actively registered at NCCC, this new CPRS message displays to the provider prior to a hard stop: \n  \n    *** This patient is not registered in the clozapine treatment program or has been discontinued from the program. A new registration number must be assigned. If this is not an emergency, contact the NCCC. For emergency registration during non-NCCC duty hours, a written order to the pharmacist can be used to process a registration override. *** \n   \n   \n  \n    Related Topics\n  \n  Viewing Medications\n  Sorting the Medications View\n  Ordering Inpatient Medications (Simple Dose)\n  Ordering Inpatient Medications (Complex Dose)\n  Ordering Outpatient Medications (Simple Dose)\n  Ordering Outpatient Medications (Complex Dose)\n  Change Medication Order\n  Discontinue Medication Order\n  Hold Medication Order\n  Renew Medication Order\n  Other Medication Actions (popup menu)\n   \n\n","Path::contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Tubefeeding.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Tubefeeding.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"tube_feeding_quantity.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Tubefeeding.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/tube_feeding_quantity.htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Diets_and_Outpatient_Meals(overview).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Tubefeeding.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Diets_and_Outpatient_Meals(overview).htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Outpatient_Recurring_Meals.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Tubefeeding.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Recurring_Meals.htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Outpatient_Special_Meals.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Tubefeeding.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Special_Meals.htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Early_Late_Trays.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Tubefeeding.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Early_Late_Trays.htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Isolations_Precautions.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Tubefeeding.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Isolations_Precautions.htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Additional_Orders.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Tubefeeding.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Additional_Orders.htm"}],"Path::contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Tubefeeding.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Tubefeeding.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Tubefeeding.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Tubefeeding.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Tubefeeding.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Tubefeeding.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Tubefeeding.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Tubefeeding.htm::Title":"Ordering Outpatient Meal Tubefeeding","Path::contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Tubefeeding.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Outpatient Meals,Outpatient Meals:tubefeeding,tubefeeding","Path::contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Meal_Tubefeeding.htm::InnerText":"\n\nOrdering Outpatient Meal Tubefeeding\nOutpatient tubefeeding orders must be associated with a recurring meal.

If the user does not enter enough characters to uniquely identify an item, CPRS waits until the user manually selects an item using the mouse or the keyboard.\n  \n   \n  3.     Select the medication name or quick order name. Once the name is selected, CPRS displays a second dialog to\n    select the items for the rest of the order. In the top field of the second dialog, the generic medication name and the synonym (usually a brand name) are displayed.\n  \n  \n    The lab results for the most recent lab test associated with the selected medication are displayed in the Information field, if an associated lab test was performed within the last 365 days.\n  \n  Note:      A CAC or ADPAC will need to set the OR CPRS LAB DISPLAY ENABLED parameter to ON to activate the lab results display at a site.\n   \n   To view associated lab results for Quick Orders, a TIU OBJECT must be inserted into the Quick Order. For more information, refer to the Text Integration Utility (TIU) Clinical Coordinator & User Manual.This functionality will work for generalized Quick Orders only (orders assigned to Order Menus). It is not currently implemented for personal Quick Orders.\n   \n  The lab results functionality will not work properly for multi-divisional facilities or any sites that use different lab test names at different sites, as only one lab test name can be associated with each drug. To successfully implement this functionality, all facilities/divisions that share a VistA system must use the same name for each monitored lab test.\n  \n    Note: \n         \n    If the selected medication is a controlled substance that requires the signature of a\n    provider with a DEA or VA number, the DEA# Required dialog will appear. Before an order for a controlled substance can be entered, the provider selected for the encounter must be able to sign the order. You may need to exit the Medication Order dialog, change the provider, and then reenter the Medication Order dialog.\n  \n   \n  4.     Select the dosage.\n  \n    The dosage may not begin with a decimal, for example .5;\n    it must begin with a numerical value, 0.5 for example. Also, the character \"^\" may not be entered in the Dosage field. (The associated cost is displayed to the right of the dosage).\n  \n  \n    Note:   CPRS now only auto-selects (highlights in blue and places that entry in the field) a medication, dosage, route, or schedule if the user types enough characters to uniquely identify an item in the list. If the user does not enter enough characters to uniquely identify an item, CPRS waits until the user manually selects an item using the mouse or the keyboard.\n  \n   \n  5.     Select a route from the Route field.\n  \n    Note:\n          Outpatient orders for supply items do not require a route.\n  \n   \n  6.     Choose a schedule from the Schedule field. (Select PRN, if desired.)\n  7.     CPRS completes the default days supply field and calculates the quantity field based on the formula days supply x schedule = quantity. If necessary, highlight and change the numbers in these fields.\n  \n    Note: \n         \n    If you change a number, CPRS will attempt to recalculate the other field. If you check PRN, be sure that the\n    quantity\n    field is correct before accepting the order.\n  \n   \n  8.     Enter the number of refills.\n  9.     Select the location where the patient should pick up the medication from the Pick Up field.\n  \n    10.   Choose a priority.\n  \n  \n    11.   Add comments in the Comments field (if desired).\n  \n  \n    12.   Under certain circumstances, a check box may appear under the Days Supply field. If the medication is service-connected, make sure the box is checked\n  \n  \n    13.   Select\n    Accept Order\n    .\n  \n  \n    14.   (Conditional) If the medication ordered may be contraindicated because of allergies, drug interactions, or duplicate orders, CPRS will display the Order Check window. Carefully review all order checks and decide if the medication should be ordered. Do one of the following:\n  \n  \n    o     \n    To proceed, select Accept Order.\n  \n  \n    o     \n    To stop the ordering process and return to the dialog, Cancel Order.\n  \n   \n  \n    15.   If you are finished ordering outpatient medications, select\n    Quit\n    .\n  \n  \n    Note:      The order must be signed before it is sent to the Pharmacy package. You can either sign the order now or wait until later.\n  \n  \n    Related Topics\n  \n  Ordering Outpatient Medications (Complex Dose)\n  Viewing Medications\n  Sorting the Medications View\n  Ordering Inpatient Medications (Simple Dose)\n  Ordering Inpatient Medications (Complex Dose)\n  Change Medication Order\n  Discontinue Medication Order\n  Hold Medication Order\n  Renew Medication Order\n  Other Medication Actions (popup menu)\n   \n\n","Path::contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"image/CPRS0029.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/image/CPRS0029.gif"},{"origLink":"image/CPRS0029.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/image/CPRS0029.gif"},{"origLink":"Ordering_a_Diet_(Diet_Tab).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_a_Diet_(Diet_Tab).htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Inpatient_Medications.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Inpatient_Medications.htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Inpatient_Medications_Complex_Dose_.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Inpatient_Medications_Complex_Dose_.htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Outpatient_Medications_(Simple_Dose).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Medications_(Simple_Dose).htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Outpatient_Medications_(Complex_Dose).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Medications_(Complex_Dose).htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Infusions.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Infusions.htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Lab_Tests.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Lab_Tests.htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Imaging_Radiology.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Imaging_Radiology.htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Consults.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Consults.htm"},{"origLink":"Text_Orders.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Text_Orders.htm"},{"origLink":"Event_Delayed_Orders.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Event_Delayed_Orders.htm"}],"Path::contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm::Title":"Ordering Vitals","Path::contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Blood:pressure,Height,I & O,Orders,Orders:vitals,Oxygen 40%,Vitals,Vitals:ordering,Vitals:QD,Weight","Path::contents/Ordering_Vitals.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Ordering Vitals\n  \n  \n    This section gives steps t\n    o place an order directing staff to collect vitals with a certain frequency over a certain time period.

Many sites have customized the items in the Write Orders pane. Check with your CAC (or the person who manages information resources at your site) if you have trouble locating the Clinic Medications item.\n      Note:  The following prompts will be slightly different based on the patient’s location. You will be asked to verify that you want to write Clinic Medications and to ensure that the encounter location is a clinic location.\n    \n    If prompted, enter the appropriate clinic for the encounter information. This will generally happen with an outpatient.\n       \n      You can use an existing appointment if one exists or create a new one.

CPRS allows orders for controlled substances only when selected providers are able to sign the orders. You may need to exit the Medication Order dialog, change the provider selection, and then reenter the dialog.\n      \n      You must have a DEA# or VA# to order certain medications\n       \n    \n    Select the Complex tab.\n      Note:  After you begin a complex dose medication order, you must remain on the Complex tab until you finish the order.

Also, the character “^” may not be entered in the Dosage field. (The associated cost is displayed to the right of the dosage.)\n      Note:   CPRS now only auto-selects (highlights in blue and places that entry in the field) a medication, dosage, route, or schedule if the user types enough characters to uniquely identify an item in the list. If the user does not enter enough characters to uniquely identify an item, CPRS waits until the user manually selects an item using the mouse or the keyboard.\n       \n    \n    \n      Enter a Route by either selecting one from the list or typing in a valid route.\n      When the user selects a regular schedule that does not have PRN, the administration times may display in the Schedule column. The administration times will display if they have been defined for the ward or if there is a default.\n       \n    \n    If you selected an existing schedule, skip to step 13. If you selected OTHER, CPRS displays the Order with Schedule ‘OTHER’ dialog. Take the following steps:\n      \n        Select one or more checkboxes by the appropriate days of the week.\n        If the schedule requires specific administration times skip to steps c and d. To select a schedule from the list, highlight the schedule and select Add.\n          Note:      Users can assign either a schedule from the list or specific administration times, but not both. If launched from the Complex tab, the Day-of-Week Schedule builder does not display one-time schedules in the schedule list. Also, because the user is specifying days of the week and a schedule, the list will contain only schedules less than 24 hours (for example, Q36H will not be in the list).\n           \n        \n        \n          To use a specific administration time, select the hour and minutes (if the user only selects the hour, the minutes will default to zero) and select Add.\n        \n        \n          Repeat step c until you have entered all required administration times\n          Warning:      The administration times in the Schedule field apply to each day of the week that is listed, such as TU-TH-SA@0800-2000, for example. To create a schedule such as TU@0800 TH@2000, users would have to enter two separate orders using the complex medication order dialog. Also, users may not enter a schedule that only has administration times and PRN but no days.\n        \n        \n          If you make a mistake while selecting an administration time or schedule, do one of the following to remove it:\n          \n            For a single administration time, highlight the hour and minutes in the Set Administration Time fields and select Remove (so to remove 08:00, you would have to select that time in the Set Administration Time fields not in the Schedule text box.)\n            To remove the schedule, highlight the schedule and select Remove.\n            To remove the entire schedule and begin again with step a, select Reset.\n          \n        \n        \n          Review the Schedule field.\n        \n        \n          When you have the correct schedule, select OK.\n          \n          The Order with Schedule ‘OTHER’ dialog allows you to enter a customized day-of-week and/or administration-time schedule. The user can enter specific administration times or select a schedule from the available list.\n           \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Select PRN if necessary.\n      PRN will display in the schedule field if the PRN checkbox is checked or if the schedule is defined in the Pharmacy files as a PRN schedule.\n       \n    \n    \n      (Optional) Enter a Comment if desire by moving the cursor to the field and typing the comment.\n    \n    \n      The date and time that the patient is scheduled to receive the first dose of the medication appears under the Comments field. (For example, CPRS cannot show an expected first dose for “on call” or schedules with PRN. On the complex tab, it will not try to determine an expected first dose after a THEN because the first item must be completed.) If you want the patient to receive an additional dose now, check the Give additional dose now check box. CPRS displays a warning box such as the one shown below\n      \n      This graphic shows the warning that ordering providers receive if they select the Give additional dose now check box. The warning makes it clear that CPRS is creating two orders with different schedules.\n        Note:    Make sure that you are careful about using give-additional-dose-now functionality. When you click the check box, CPRS creates two new orders and sends it to Inpatient Medications. Make sure the “Give additional dose now” and the regular order with the original schedule you entered do not overmedicate the patient. “Give additional dose now” is not available for ONCE, ONE-TIME, or NOW orders. It is also not available for delayed orders.\n    \n    \n      Check the warning message to ensure that the orders you created are what you expected. If the orders are acceptable, select OK. If not, select Cancel to clear the Give additional dose now check box.\n    \n    \n      Select Accept Order.\n      Note:   If you do not complete the mandatory items or if the information is incorrect, CPRS sends a message telling you that the information is incorrect and showing you the correct type of response\n       \n    \n    \n      (Conditional) If the medication ordered may be contraindicated because of allergies, drug interactions, or duplicate orders, CPRS will display the Order Check window. Carefully review all order checks and decide if the medication should be ordered. Do one of the following:\n      \n        To proceed, select Accept Order.\n        To stop the ordering process and return to the dialog, Cancel Order.\n        \n           \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Enter another medication or\n      -or-\n      select Quit.\n       \n    \n    \n      When you select Quit, if the patient is in inpatient, CPRS changes the patient’s location back to where the patient was before changing to the clinic.\n    \n  \n   \n  \n    Related topics\n  \n  Clinic Medications (Overview)\n  \n      Ordering Complex Clinic Medications\n    \n  \n      Sorting the Medications View\n    \n  Changing or Copying Clinic Orders\n\n","Path::contents/Patient_Lists.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Patient_Lists.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Setting_a_Default_Patient_List.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Patient_Lists.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Setting_a_Default_Patient_List.htm"}],"Path::contents/Patient_Lists.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Patient_Lists.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Patient_Lists.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Patient_Lists.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Patient_Lists.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Patient_Lists.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Patient_Lists.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Patient_Lists.htm::Title":"Patient Lists","Path::contents/Patient_Lists.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"list,Patient,Patient:lists","Path::contents/Patient_Lists.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Patient Lists\n  \n  \n    You or your clinical coordinator can create patient or team lists that simplify tasks such as reviewing patient charts, ordering, and signing orders and notes.

Each advisory or flag includes a narrative that describes the reason for the flag and may include some suggested actions for users to take when they encounter the patient. Other information displayed to the user includes the Flag Type, Flag Category, Assignment Status, Initial Assignment Date, Approved by, Next Review Date, Owner Site, and Originating Site. When assigning a flag, authorized users\n    must write a progress note that clinically justifies each flag action.\n  \n  \n    Flags are defined in the PRF List Manager software either through a patch or by an authorized user. Once the flag definition exists, authorized users can use the following actions in the\n    PRF software to assign and maintain the flag on a specific patient's record: new assignment, continue, inactivate, mark as entered in error, and reactivate.\n  \n  \n    To make flags widely available to VHA employees who interact with patients, Patient Record Flags are tied to the patient look-up. Whenever a user looks up a patient, the software checks to see if the patient's record has been flagged, and if a flag exists, the software displays the list of flag names.\n  \n  \n    To ensure that users notice them, CPRS uses a Patient Record Flags pop-up box. After a user selects a patient with an active flag assignment, CPRS pops up a dialog containing all flags for the patient. Users can review the flags or close the box. The rest\n    of the patient record does not load until the user closes the PRF pop-up box. Once the rest of the record is loaded, users can view flags at any time using the Flag button or the Cover Sheet list of PRF displayed on the upper right of the Cover Sheet under Patient Record Flags.\n  \n  \n    Sites can help users notice the flags by using Patient Record Flags judiciously. Over\n    using these flags could make them cumbersome to users who might therefore choose to ignore them. Ignoring flags could put employees, other patients,\n    and the health care environment at risk.\n  \n  \n    To avoid this situation, before placing a flag on a patient's record, sites must have in place a system for deciding when a flag is appropriate and when it will be reviewed. Sites should also have policies about how to handle questions about flags. To give sites some direction about implementing Patient Record Flags,\n    VHA DIRECTIVE 2010-053, dated December 3, 2010, titled:\n    Patient Record Flags\n    has been issued\n    .\n  \n   \n  \n    Category I and Category II Flags\n  \n  \n    Patient Record Flags are divided into types: Category I (national) and Category II (local). Category I Patient Record Flags are the most critical and are transmitted to all facilities, ensuring that these flags are universally available. Category II Patient Record Flags are local only, belonging only to the site that created them; they are not shared between sites.\n  \n   \n  \n    Category I or National Flags\n  \n  \n    Currently, the only Category I Patient Record Flag is a Behavioral flag for violent or potentially violent patients. The Office\n    of Information created this flag to help VHA properly protect its employees and maintain a safe environment for health care. The Office of Information defines and distributes Category I flags through national patches and the definition of the flag cannot\n    be edited by local sites.\n  \n  \n    Each Category I flag assignment to a specific patient's record is owned by a single facility. The facility that placed the Category I flag on the patient's record would normally own and maintain the flag. The site that owns the Category I flag is the only site that can:\n  \n  ·      review whether to remove or continue the flag\n  ·      edit the flag\n  ·      inactivate the flag\n  ·      reactivate the flag\n  ·      mark the flag as entered in error\n  ·      change ownership of the flag\n  \n    ·      enter a Patient Record Flag Category I\n    progress note for the flag\n  \n   \n  \n    However, ownership of a Category I flag assignment can be transferred. If a patient received the majority of care at a different VA facility than the one that assigned the flag, the site giving the majority of care could request that ownership of the flag be transferred to the that site. The owning site could then change the ownership to the second site through the PRF software in List Manager.\n  \n   \n  \n    Category II or Local Flags\n  \n  \n    Category II flags are local. Each site can create and maintain its own set of local flags that are not transmitted to other sites. However, the purpose of Category II flags is similar to Category I--to provide important patient information to health care providers. For example, a site could create a Patient Record Flags Cat II -  Diabetes flag or a Category II Infectious Disease flag.\n  \n  \n    In\n    VHA DIRECTIVE 2010-053, dated December 3, 2010, titled:\n    Patient Record Flags\n    , VHA advised sites to create and use Patient Record Flags sparingly so that users will notice\n    flags and pay careful attention to them. Creating a large number of flags for many different reasons might lessen the impact of flags and cause staff to miss important information. Both Category I flags and Category II flags require a progress note to document the reason for placing a flag on the patient's record.\n  \n   \n  \n    Creating, Assigning, and Maintaining PRF\n  \n  \n    Some sites may have two different groups of users who work with Patient Record Flags: administrative users who create, maintain, and assign flags and the\n    clinical users that document why the flag was placed on the patient's record. Authorized users can define Category II flags and edit their definitions. They assign and maintain the flag on a patient's record using the assignment actions in the PRF software\n    through the List Manager interface: new assignment, continue, inactivate, mark as entered in error, and reactivate. (Additional documentation for PRF creation, assignment, and maintenance is available in the\n    Patient Record Flags User Guide\n    .)\n  \n   \n  \n    Documentin\n    g PRF\n  \n  \n    With CPRS GUI v.26, each Patient Record Flag action (new assignment, continue, inactivate, reactivate, or mark as entered in error) must have a linked progress note that clinically justifies any action taken. Previously, each flag needed to have a pr\n    ogress note, but there was no link between the note and the flag action. Now when the user writes a PRF progress note, the user must link the note to a flag action. The note might also contain references to supporting documentation.\n  \n  \n    In each flag definition, the user must select the previously created PRF progress note title that will document the reasons for any flag action. This is referred to as associating a progress note title with a PRF. Before a title can be associated with a PRF, the title must be created either by a patch for a national flag or by someone at the site for a local flag.\n  \n  \n    For example, if a user were defining a Wandering flag in the PRF List Manager software, someone at the site must have already used TIU to create the appropriate note\n    title in the correct document class. Then, the user defining the flag would associate a title such as, Patient Record Flag Category II -  Risk, Wandering, by selecting that title from the list of available PRF progress note titles.\n  \n  \n    Once the flag and the progress note title are associated, when the user writing a new progress note selects a PRF progress note title, CPRS displays the flag actions on the selected patient and whether each action has been linked to PRF progress note (Yes\n    or No). For the new PRF note, the user then selects the available flag action to create the link between the note and the flag action.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n          There is a one-to-one correspondence between flag actions and progress notes. Each PRF action for a patient can only be linked to one progress note; each progress note can only be linked to one flag action.\n  \n   \n  \n    Prerequisites to Writing PRF Progress Notes\n  \n  \n    Before users can write progress notes that document PRF, PRF progress note titles must be set up correctly. Each PRF progress note title must be associated with a specific flag definition, and users must be assigned to the appropriate user classes to write specific kinds of notes. Also, someone must have assigned the flag to the patient.\n  \n  \n    For users to write a progress note\n    and correctly link the note to a flag action, sites must complete the following set up:\n  \n  ·      To write a PRF note for a category I flag, the user must belong to the DGPF PATIENT RECORD FLAG MGR user class. Each site will be responsible for populating this user class.\n  \n    ·      Because Category II Patient Record Flags are local, each site must determine if the site will create a user class and\n    business rules to govern which users can write Category II PRF progress notes.\n  \n  ·      The PRF note titles should follow the naming conventions described in the directive and be descriptive enough that users can tell which note title corresponds to which flag.\n  ·      The flag definition must contain the progress note title that documents actions for that flag--each PRF note title can only be associated with one flag.\n  \n    ·      Category II PRF progress note titles must be in the Patient Record Flag Cat II document class under\n    the Progress Notes document class to allow users to associate them with a PRF Category II definition. If the titles are not in this document class, they will not display when the user attempts to associate the title with a PRF Category II flag nor will CPRS get the information about which flags actions are linked. Progress note titles for Category I patient record flags are defined and associated by national patch.\n  \n   \n  \n    PRF Note Titles\n  \n  \n    Currently, there is only one Category I flag: Behavioral. The Progress Note\n    title for documenting this flag is \"Patient Record Flag Category I\".\n  \n  \n    To help sites that will be creating local Category II flags, four partially customizable Progress Note titles have been distributed:\n  \n  \n    ·      Patient Record Flag Category II -\n    Risk, Fall\n  \n  \n    ·      Patient Record Flag Category II -\n    Risk, Wandering\n  \n  \n    ·      Patient Record Flag Category II - Research Study\n  \n  \n    ·      Patient Record Flag Category II - Infectious Disease\n  \n   \n  \n    Clinical Application Coordinators (CACs) can customize these titles by changing the text after the dash\n    using TIU utilities. For example, the first title could be changed from \"Patient Record Flag Category II - Risk, Fall\" to \"Patient Record Flag Category\n    II - Behavioral, Drug Seeking\" or other titles sites create.\n  \n  \n    CACs can also create their own titles, but the title must follow the naming convention \"Patient Record Flag Category I -  other text\"\n    where\n    other text\n    is the text specific to the local note title.\n  \n   \n   \n  \n    Linking PRF Notes to Flag Actions\n  \n  \n    In the CPRS GUI, users must link a PRF progress note to a flag action when the user writes a PRF note. This linking can also be done through the List Manager interface using TIU options. In the CPRS GUI's Progress Note Properties dialog, when a user selects a Patient Record Flag progress note title, CPRS displays a list of flag actions to which the note can be linked at the bottom of the dialog. This list shows all the actions for the flag and whether each action has\n    been linked.\n  \n  \n    For progress note titles that document the justification for a patient record flag, users will be able to link the progress note to the specific flag action they are documenting. The example shown here is of a Category I PRF progress note and\n    the Continue action to which the user would choose to link.\n  \n  \n    Note:      For PRF notes, users must select a flag action to link the note to before they can write the note--the same way users link a note with a consult. CPRS will not allow the user to write the note unless an unused flag action is selected. If the user does not select a flag action, CPRS displays a dialog that states, \"Notes of this title require the selection of a patient record flag action\".\n  \n   \n  \n    When the user select a PRF progress note title, CPRS displays this list of note actions only if sites have done the correct set up as described earlier. The user must then pick the action (new assignment, inactivate, reactivate, continue, or entered in error) that the note is documenting.\n  \n  \n    If a user is viewing\n    a note and wants to see to which PRF action the note is linked, the user can select View | Details on the Notes tab. The details include the flag name, the date, and the action that was linked.\n  \n  \n    If a user writing a new progress note chooses a PRF progress note but CPRS does not display any flag actions for linking, one of the following has probably occurred:\n  \n  ·      The flag has not been assigned to this patient yet.\n  ·      The user has selected the wrong progress note title for the flag.\n  \n    ·      If it is a Category I flag,\n    the site may not own the flag.\n  \n   \n  \n    Marking PRF as Entered in Error\n  \n  \n    Marking PRF as entered in error terminates the flag's display in the patient's record. However, if there was a progress note linked to the flag, the progress note is still in the patient's record. If the flag was entered in error, an authorized TIU user should retract or retract and reassign the linked progress note.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n     \n         \n    Users should be aware that although the flag does not display, a history of this flag is kept in the Patient Record Flag software and users can reactivate the flag. To prevent users from entering notes on previous, inaccurate PRF actions, all previous PRF actions are hidden when\n    a flag is marked as entered in error.\n  \n   \n  \n    Related topics\n  \n  Viewing Patient Record Flags\n   \n\n","Path::contents/Patients_on_personal_list.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/cprswt.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Patients_on_personal_list.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/cprswt.css"}],"Path::contents/Patients_on_personal_list.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Patients_on_personal_list.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Patients_on_personal_list.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Patients_on_personal_list.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Patients_on_personal_list.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Patients_on_personal_list.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Patients_on_personal_list.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Patients_on_personal_list.htm::Title":"Patients on personal list","Path::contents/Patients_on_personal_list.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Remove patients to your personal list by selecting patients and using the Remove or Remove All buttons.

Treatment factors, SNOMED CT codes, and ICD-9-CM codes display right after the problem text. If they have been specified by the provider, ICD-10-CM codes can be seen in the detailed display.\n   \n  Coding Systems Used to Represent Problems\n  Problems in CPRS are represented using two systems: Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) codes and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes. SNOMED CT terminology is the designated national standard for Problem List for clinically expressing problems and to support interoperability and data exchange within VA, DoD, and external partners. ICD-10-CM codes are primarily used for reimbursement purposes. Previously, only ICD codes were used to define problems. SNOMED CT should help providers better define problems, while also mapping to ICD codes in the background.\n   \n  Depending on the method for documenting a problem, the problem represented in SNOMED CT may or may not be linked to an ICD-10-CM code(s). If the user selects a problem from the National Problem Selection List, the problem will be linked to ICD-10-CM code(s). If the user selects a problem from within the Lexicon Utility, the problem will be linked to an R69 code (an unspecified problem).\n   \n  Using Problems for Encounter Information\n  The Problem List application passes all patients’ problems to the Encounter Form. These problems can be viewed under the Problem List Item section of the Diagnosis tab and may be utilized for Encounter check out.  However, if the problem is linked to an inactive code or represented in ICD-9-CM, the system requires the user to update the problem. Updates may require the user to link the problem to an active SNOMED CT or ICD-10-CM code.\n   \n  \n      Related Topics\n    \n  \n        Adding a Problem\n      \n  \n        Annotating a Problem\n      \n  \n        Changing a Problem\n      \n  \n        Customizing the Problems List\n      \n  \n        Making a Problem Inactive\n      \n  \n        Removing a Problem\n      \n  Verifying a Problem\n   \n\n","Path::contents/procedures.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/procedures.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"}],"Path::contents/procedures.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/procedures.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/procedures.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/procedures.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/procedures.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/procedures.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/procedures.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/procedures.htm::Title":"procedures","Path::contents/procedures.htm::InnerText":"\nProcedures\nRadiology/Nuclear Medicine procedures, ECGs, etc.\n\n\n","Path::contents/Processing_Notifications.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Processing_Notifications.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"image/CPRS0038.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Processing_Notifications.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/image/CPRS0038.gif"},{"origLink":"Notifications__Notifications_and_Alerts.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Processing_Notifications.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Notifications__Notifications_and_Alerts.htm"},{"origLink":"Sorting_Notifications_and_Viewing_Comments_of_Forwarded_Alerts.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Processing_Notifications.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Sorting_Notifications_and_Viewing_Comments_of_Forwarded_Alerts.htm"},{"origLink":"Removing_Notifications.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Processing_Notifications.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Removing_Notifications.htm"},{"origLink":"Forwarding_a_Notification_to_Another_User.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Processing_Notifications.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Forwarding_a_Notification_to_Another_User.htm"},{"origLink":"Deferring_Notifications.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Processing_Notifications.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Deferring_Notifications.htm"}],"Path::contents/Processing_Notifications.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Processing_Notifications.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Processing_Notifications.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Processing_Notifications.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Processing_Notifications.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Processing_Notifications.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Processing_Notifications.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Processing_Notifications.htm::Title":"Processing Notifications","Path::contents/Processing_Notifications.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Forward notifications,Notifications,Notifications:forward,Notifications:processing,Notifications:remove,Notifications:renew,Processing,Processing:Notifications,Remove,Remove:notification,Renew,Renew:notifications,Viewing,Viewing:notifications","Path::contents/Processing_Notifications.htm::InnerText":"\nProcessing Notifications\nCPRS provides you with flexibility in processing, removing, forwarding, and deferring  Notifications. First you select the alerts that you want to act on and then click the appropriate button. For processing notifications, you have three choices: Process Info, Process All, and Process, which will process those notifications that you have highlighted. When you are processing notifications, you can also renew a notification, which ensures that you will see the notification again the next time you log in, or forward the notification to one or more users.\nNote:      Sometimes CPRS will display an alert that belongs to a sensitive record--one that the user cannot view. CPRS blocks access to sensitive records when the user is processing notifications and alerts. If the alert that cannot be viewed is the first one to be processed, CPRS will give an error message and return to the Patient Selection screen. If the sensitive record is for an alert other than the first, CPRS will process the alerts until it gets to the sensitive record and will then return the user to the Patient Selection screen. Then the user can reselect alerts, excluding the one to the sensitive record, and continue processing.\n \nTo process notifications, use these steps:\n1.     Bring up the Patient Selection screen, either by launching CPRS or if you are already running CPRS, selecting File | Select New Patient.\n2.     Decide which notifications to process.\no     To process all information notifications (items preceded by an I.), click Process Info.\no     To process all notifications, click Process All.\no     To process specific notifications, highlight one or more notifications, and then click Process. You can also process a notification by double-clicking on it.\nNote:      To select a number of notifications in a row, click the first item, hold down the Shift key, and click the last item. All items in the range will be selected. To select multiple items that are not in a row, click one, hold down the Control key, and click the other specific notifications.\n \n3.     Process the notification by completing the necessary task, such as signing an overdue order or viewing information notifications.\nNote:  For AudioRenewal requests that cannot be automatically renewed for some reason, CPRS has a new notification. The NonRenewable RX Request for notification is an action alert that takes the user to the orders tab. The user can then use the Copy to New Order feature (because the order cannot be renewed) if they want to continue the medication therapy for the patient. If providers receive an alert for a patient they no longer see, they can Forward the alert to the appropriate provider. Who receives the alert is based on the set up for the alert. Contact your CAC or similar personnel if you are repeatedly getting alerts for the wrong patients.\n4.     If you want to renew or forward this notification to someone else, right-click the Next button and select either Renew or Forward as shown in the graphic below. If you selected Forward, proceed to step 5.

CPRS remembers which printer you\n    used last and will print to that printer again unless you changed it for the duration of the session. You can also configure and save a printer as the default for the user.\n  \n  \n    The print dialog enables the user to print a single item. A similar dialog, without\n    the Chart copy / Work copy option appears for items on other tabs. Many report boxes now have Print button on them to make it easier for you to print the information you need.\n  \n  \n    Normally, you do not need to enter a right margin or page length value. These values are measured in characters and normally are already defined by the device.\n  \n  \n    You will also still have the options to print your regular tasked jobs.\n  \n   \n  \n    Printing Multiple Notes, Consults, or Discharge Summaries\n  \n  \n    The ability to print multiple Progress Notes, Consults, and Discharge Summaries has been added to the CPRS GUI.

If you do not have a default title when you begin a new document, you will be prompted for specific information before entering note text.\n  \n  \n    When you start a new document, CPRS must have a document\n    title, date, and author. Depending on the type of document you select, you may also have to enter an expected cosigner or an associated consult.\n  \n  \n    By getting this information when you begin the document, CPRS can then auto-save your document as you create i\n    t to minimize data lost if your system crashes or exits prematurely.\n  \n  The auto-save interval is determined by a CPRS parameter.\n   \n  \n    Changing the Document Title, Author, Date\n  \n  \n    With this version of CPRS, you can change the title, author, date, expected\n    cosigner, and other reference information for a document while you are editing the document. In addition, you have the choice to ignore, append, or replace boilerplate text when changing to a document title that has boilerplate text.\n  \n   \n  \n    Images Ass\n    ociated with a Document\n  \n  \n    If your site uses the CPRS GUI and VistA Imaging, you can have images associated with documents. To view the image, you must have the VistA Imaging Display program on the workstation you are using.\n  \n  \n    To simultaneously view a document\n    and the associated images, you will need to be running both VistA Imaging Display and the CPRS GUI. When you click on a document in CPRS that has an associated image, CPRS will bring up the note text and VistA Imaging Display will display the associated\n    i\n    mages.\n  \n  \n    To show you which documents have associated images, CPRS displays a small icon next to the document title in the document list. An example is shown in the graphic below.\n  \n  \n   \n  \n    Document Templates\n  \n  \n    In the Windows version of CPRS, Progress Notes can be created using templates--predefined text that both clinical coordinators and individual users can create and save, to later be entered into a note with a few clicks of the mouse.\n  \n  You can create individual templates, group templates, and dialog templates. And you can organize them into a hierarchical structure using folders. You can also include Patient Data Objects (TIU objects) in your templates.\n   \n  \n    Progre\n    ss Notes Created During Reminder Processing\n  \n  The combination of the Windows version of CPRS and the new Clinical Reminders package will add another facet to Progress Note creation. As clinicians use the new reminder functionality to meet Clinical Guidelines, they will be able to quickly click on the appropriate check boxes in dialogs that sites will build to document an encounter, including entering PCE data, placing orders if wanted, and entering predefined text into their Progress Note.\n   \n  \n    Related Topics\n  \n  \n      Vie\n      wing Progress Notes\n    \n  \n      Writing a New Progress Note\n    \n  \n      Changing a Document's Author, Title, Reference, etc.\n    \n  Document Templates (overview)\n   \n\n","Path::contents/Provider_Selection_Critieria_for_Similar_Names.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Provider_Selection_Critieria_for_Similar_Names.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"}],"Path::contents/Provider_Selection_Critieria_for_Similar_Names.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Provider_Selection_Critieria_for_Similar_Names.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Provider_Selection_Critieria_for_Similar_Names.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Provider_Selection_Critieria_for_Similar_Names.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Provider_Selection_Critieria_for_Similar_Names.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Provider_Selection_Critieria_for_Similar_Names.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Provider_Selection_Critieria_for_Similar_Names.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Provider_Selection_Critieria_for_Similar_Names.htm::Title":"Provider Selection Critieria for Similar Names","Path::contents/Provider_Selection_Critieria_for_Similar_Names.htm::InnerText":"\nTo help you distinguish between providers, CPRS displays their titles (if available).

It has a value for some\n    or all of the fields for the specific type of order selected. For example, on an outpatient medication order, the user might define the type of medication, dosage, route, and schedule, quantity, and number of refills. If the user does not define a value\n    f\n    or one or more mandatory fields, CPRS will display the dialog for the user to fill in the missing values. Quick orders can be created for many different types of orders. There are two types of quick orders: personal and shared.\n  \n  \n    Personal Quick Orders\n  \n  \n    Personal quick orders are created when a user fills out the order dialog, but before the user accepts the order, the user can select Options | Save as Quick Order... and give the quick order a name. CPRS saves the order, and it can then be used from that same dialog where it was created by the user that created it. Personal quick orders display at the top of the list of orders and are separated from the rest of the orders by a line.\n  \n  \n    For example, if a user creates a lab order and then saves it as a personal quick\n    order, the user will give the personal quick order a name and that item will appear at the top of the lab order dialog with any other personal quick orders, followed by a line and then the full list of lab orders the next time that user opens the dialog.\n  \n  \n    To create a personal quick order, use these steps:\n  \n  1.     Fill out an order dialog for a medication, lab, or other order that you frequently place, but DO NOT select Accept.\n  \n    2.     With the order dialog still up, select\n    Options | Save as Quick Order...\n    .\n  \n  \n    3.     In the Add Quick Orders (\n    type\n    ) dialog, where type is the package or type of order, such as Labs, Outpatient meds, etc., enter a name for the quick order and select\n    OK\n    .\n  \n  \n    Note:\n          \n    You cannot save personal quick orders with the same name, even if the capitalization is different.\n  \n   \n  \n    To manage personal quick orders, use these steps:\n  \n  1.     Open the appropriate ordering dialog (Outpatient Meds, Inpatient Meds, Infusions, Labs, etc.).\n  \n    2.     Select\n    Options | Edit Common List...\n    .\n  \n  3.     To rename a personal quick order, do the following:\n  \n    a)     Highlight the personal quick order name.\n  \n  \n    b)     Select the\n    Rename\n    button.\n  \n  \n    c)     In the Rename dialog, type the new name for the personal quick order and select\n    OK\n    .\n  \n  \n    d)     Repeat steps a-c if needed to rename additional orders.\n  \n   \n  4.     To change the position of a personal quick order in the list, do the following:\n  a)     Highlight the personal quick order name.\n  b)     Use the arrow buttons to the left of the name list to move the name up or down to the chosen position.\n  \n    c)     Repeat steps a and b if\n    needed to arrange the list to your preference.\n  \n   \n  5.     To delete a quick order, do the following:\n  a)     Highlight the personal quick order to be deleted.\n  \n    b)     Select the\n    Delete\n    button.\n  \n  c)     Repeat steps a and b if needed to delete additional personal quick orders.\n   \n  \n    6.     When finished managing the personal quick order list, select\n    OK\n    .\n  \n   \n  \n    Site-Wide Quick Orders\n  \n  \n    Many sites have created an entire set of Quick Orders that they use. IRM staff at each site can customize the Write Orders list box with a selection that will bring up the Quick Order menus they have created. This item might be called Assign New Orders, Common Orders, or whatever the site deems appropriate. When a clinician clicks on this item, CPRS brings up the menu containing Quick Orders and other orders defined by the site. Sites can set up orderables to be Quick Orders. See your clinical coordinator if you have items you wish to have set up as site-wide Quick Orders.\n  \n  \n    Shared quick orders are created in VistA by someone like a Clinical Applications Coordinator (CAC). These quick orders can be made available to all CPRS users by placing them on order menus, and can be used in order sets.\n  \n   \n  \n    Related topics\n  \n  Placing a Quick Order\n   \n\n","Path::contents/References.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/References.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Glossary.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/References.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Glossary.htm"}],"Path::contents/References.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/References.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/References.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/References.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/References.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/References.htm::Bookmarks":[{"id":"UniqueId0","tagName":"object","innerText":"\n\n"}],"Path::contents/References.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/References.htm::Title":"References","Path::contents/References.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"FAQ,References (web page and glossary)","Path::contents/References.htm::InnerText":"\nReferences\nBelow are two links.

If these patches have been installed and the proper parameters have been set, you can access remot\n    e\n    data generated at other VA and Department of Defense (DOD) facilities.\n  \n   \n  \n  \n    Text on the Remote Data and VistaWeb buttons\n  \n   \n  The CPRS user now has two choices for viewing remote data. One is the traditional Remote Data View (which has been streamlined), the other is VistAWeb. Each system has its advantages.\n  \n      Note:\n           The Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV) is a new way to view remote data and will eventually replace VistaWeb. JLV is available now. Some sites may not switch to JLV until VistAWeb is decommissioned, while others may choose to transition sooner. This transition should be made in collaboration with local Informatics staff and the JLV team. When the change occurs, the existing VistaWeb button can be renamed and redirected to take the user to the JLV.\n  \n    The rest of this section follows Remote Data Views. If you want to use VistAWeb, documentation is available on the VistAWeb VA intranet page at http://domaindomain.ext/vistaweb\n  \n  \n    If the pat\n    ient has remote data, the VistaWeb button text changes color to blue. If the user selects the VistaWeb button, the button changes appearance to look as if it is depressed. It will keep that appearance until the user selects a new patient.\n  \n  \n    When VistaWeb is\n    launched by CPRS Context Management is maintained. This means that VistAWeb will change patients whenever the user selects a new patient in CPRS.\n  \n   \n  \n    How Do I Know a Patient Has Remote Medical Data?\n  \n  \n    As part of opening a patient record, CPRS checks in the Treating Specialty file to see if the selected patient visited other facilities. If the patient has remote data, the words on the Remote Data button turn blue. If there is no remote data for the sele\n    c\n    ted patient, the letters are gray and the button unavailable.\n  \n  \n    If the user selects the Remote Data button with the blue text indicating that there is remote data, CPRS displays a list of sites that tells the user where and when the patient has been seen.\n  \n  \n    W\n    hat Does the List of Sites Represent?\n  \n  \n    If you select on the Remote Data button, a drop-down list appears with the name(s) of sites where the patient has been seen. This list is based on either:\n  \n  ·      Sites that have been specifically designated for your facility to access. These sites are assigned in a parameter that your Clinical Applications Coordinator (CAC) can set up.\n  ·      All VA sites where the patient has been seen and any Department of Defense remote data if it is available.\n   \n  \n    What Kind of Data Can I View?\n  \n  \n    Currently with CPRS, you can view some lab and health summary components. There are limitations to what you can view.\n  \n  ·    You can view any lab results that do not require input other than a date range.\n  ·    All reports listed on the Reports tab unless they are labeled \"local only\"\n  \n    ·    You can view health summary components that have the same name on both the local and the remote site. You can therefore exchange national Health Summaries, but locally defined components may not be available unless the other site also\n    has a component with the same name.\n  \n  ·     If it is available, CPRS can also show some Department of Defense remote data.\n   \n  \n    How Will the Remote Data Be Viewed?\n  \n  \n    Viewing remote data is a two-step process. First, you select which remote sites you want to see data\n    from, and then you select the specific information you want to view, such as lab tests or Health Summary components.\n  \n  \n    On the Reports tab, each site you select will have a separate tab for its data.

The project makes several enhancements involving scheduling appointments, including the ability to create an order in CPRS that is sent to Scheduling so that a clerk can schedule one or more appointments for a patient to return to a clinic for additional visits.\nNote:   The Return to Clinic dialog will only be available to the user if the appropriate VistA Scheduling Enhancements patch (SD*5.3*671) has been installed on your system.\nThe Return to Clinic dialog has several fields that enable the user to specify the details related to the patient returning for one or more appointments:\n\nQuick Orders: This field lists any personal quick orders that the user has already saved for himself or herself. To create Return to Clinic personal quick orders, enter all the necessary data in the Return to Clinic order dialog, but do not select Accept yet. Then, save it as a Personal Quick Order.\nClinic: The clinic the patient should return to\nDate: The date the patient should return to the clinic\nTime Sensitive: Whether the appointment is Time-Sensitive\n\n\nNot Time Sensitive (box unchecked): If the appointment is not time-sensitive, the order will read “on or around”.\nTime Sensitive (box checked): If the appointment is Time Sensitive, the order text will read “no later than”.\n\n\nNumber of Appointments: Providers enter the number of future appointments they would like to request. The number of return appointments is limited to 60.\nInterval in day(s): Note that this field is only available when the number of appointments is greater than 1. Providers can enter the number of days between appointments. For example, a provider may want to request a number of appointments 14 days apart. The maximum interval is 30 days.\nPrerequisites (check all that apply): This item is available only if the site puts items into a parameter where prerequisites are defined. For example, if nothing is put in the parameter, the user will not have any selections in this field. However, if the site puts in labs or radiology, the provider can select as many of those items as apply.\nComments: This is where the user can enter their own comments for the scheduler to see.\nMore Information: This field displays information to the user while they are creating the order. This is information entered by the site, rather than by the provider.\nOrder Sig: This field is created as information is entered into the dialog by the user.\n\n\nTo order a request for return or follow-up appointments, please use these steps:\n\nOn the CPRS Orders tab under the Write Orders pane, select Return to Clinic.\nIn the Return to Clinic dialog, if you have saved a Quick Order that you would like to use, select the down arrow and then select the quick order. If not, proceed to step 3.\nSelect the Clinic field’s drop-down box’s arrow and then the appropriate clinic name. (This is a required field.)\nIn the Date field, select the date. (This is a required field.)\nIf the appointment is time-sensitive, select the Time Sensitive check box. Selecting the Time Sensitive check box will change the order text in the Order Sig from “on or around” to “no later than”.\nIf you want more than one appointment, place the cursor in the Number of Appointments field, enter the number of appointments.\nIn the Interval in day(s) field, enter the number of days between appointments.\nIf the field is active, you can select the Prerequisites field, you can select one or more prerequisites, such as lab work or imaging, that should precede the appointments.\nIn the Comments field, type in any comments that should go with the orders.\nIn the More Information field, additional information displays for the user to see.\nReview the Order Sig to ensure that it is as you need it.\nNote:     If the order is one that the user will reuse frequently, the user can save it as a personal quick order. To save this as a quick order, go to the menu bar and select Options | Save as Personal Quick Order. Then, the order will display in the Quick order field the next time the dialog is opened.\n\nIf the Order Sig is correct, select Accept.\n \nAfter the user signs the order, the order is sent to Scheduling so that a clerk can make the requested appointments.\n\n\nHere is an example of an unsigned Return to Clinic order displayed on the Orders tab. The display shows a Return to Clinic order under the new Service category of Clinic Scheduling.\n\nClinic Scheduling orders can have the following statuses:\n\nUnreleased: The order will have this status before it is signed.\nPending: The order will have this status after it is signed but before being acted upon by the Scheduling package.\nCompleted: The order will have this status after Scheduling has acted up on it.\nDiscontinued: The order will have this status if the order is discontinued in CPRS prior to being acted upon by the Scheduling package.\n\n \nAfter the Clinic Scheduling order is signed, if the user right-clicks on the order, only two items will be available: Discontinue and Change. This is different from medications orders, for example.\nThis capture show the detailed display for a Return to clinic order.\n\n\n\n","Path::contents/Save_Changes_button_(Personal_Lists).htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/cprswt.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Save_Changes_button_(Personal_Lists).htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/cprswt.css"}],"Path::contents/Save_Changes_button_(Personal_Lists).htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Save_Changes_button_(Personal_Lists).htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Save_Changes_button_(Personal_Lists).htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Save_Changes_button_(Personal_Lists).htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Save_Changes_button_(Personal_Lists).htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Save_Changes_button_(Personal_Lists).htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Save_Changes_button_(Personal_Lists).htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Save_Changes_button_(Personal_Lists).htm::Title":"Save Changes button (Personal Lists)","Path::contents/Save_Changes_button_(Personal_Lists).htm::InnerText":"\nSaves patients to this personal list.

If you select a category, CPRS displays the associated patients in the Patients list box, followed by a line, and then the comprehensive patient list. Your Clinical Coordinator will usually create the lists for the teams, wards, and so on, but you can create personal lists using Tools | Options.\nTo locate a patient name, you can either type in part or all of their name, the social security number, or the first letter of the patient's last name and last four digits of the social security number. When you stop typing, CPRS will use what you entered to search the patient list and bring up that part of the patient list, highlight a possible match, and display the patient's demographic information under the Cancel button.\nTo open a patient record, use these steps:\n1.     If you are just opening CPRS, skip to step 2. Otherwise, select File | Select New Patient....\nNote:      If you have just entered orders or documents that are unsigned, a screen will pop up asking you to review / sign the changes.\n \n2.     In the Patient Selection screen, use one of the following methods to choose a patient:\no     Type the patient's social security number with or without dashes (000-44-4444 or 000444444); or the full social security number with \"P\" as the last character (000-44-4444p, or 000444444p).\no     Type all or part of the patient's last name or the patient's entire name.\no     Type the first letter of the patient's last name and the last four digit of the patient's Social Security number (c4444).\n \nCPRS will try to match what you entered to a patient and highlight that patient. The patient's name and other information will appear below the Cancel button.\nNote:     CPRS now only auto-selects (highlights in blue and places that entry in the field) a patient name if the user types enough characters to uniquely identify a name in the list. If the user does not enter enough characters to uniquely identify an item, CPRS waits until the user explicitly selects an item using the mouse or the keyboard.\n \n3.     Verify that the correct patient is highlighted. If the correct patient is highlighted, select OK. If the correct patient is not highlighted, scroll through to find the correct patient, highlight the name, and then select OK.\nWhen you click OK, CPRS opens to the Cover Sheet (unless you have set this to a different tab, which you can do using Tools | Options).\nYou can also use the radio buttons under the Patient List heading (located on the left-side of the window) to group the patient list according to provider, team, specialty, clinic, or ward. When you select a specific list for a provider, team, specialty, clinic, or ward, CPRS will display the associated patients in the Patients list box, followed by a line, and then the comprehensive patient list. You can then scroll to find the name. Your Clinical Coordinator will usually create the lists for the teams, wards, and so on.\n \nHow CPRS Sorts Names\nVistA software uses a set of characters that include uppercase and lowercase Latin alphabetic characters (A-Z, a-z), numbers (0-9), and other special characters.\nThis is important because of how names are sorted if the user is searching for a partial name. If VistA has stored characters other than the Latin alphabetic and numeric, such as ñ, and the user does a partial search (types in only part of the name, for example), the names may not display in the order the user expects.\nFor example, if you had patients or clinicians with names like Pina, Piña, Piñon, Pine, Pinto, Pitcher, Pitt, Pixon, and Pizzelo, and the Piña and Piñon were entered with an ñ. If the user typed in \"pi\" as what CPRS should search for, CPRS would display the names as shown below:\nPina\nPine\nPinto\nPitcher\nPitt\nPixon\nPizzelo\nPiña\nPiñon\n \nNote that Piña is after Pizzelo. This is because VistA sorts these characters based on their numeric values in the character set VistA uses. For example, in that table, the number for lowercase \"a\" might be 97, \"z\" might be 122, and \"ñ\" might be 241. Characters other than the uppercase and lowercase Latin alphabetic characters and numbers, such as ñ or the tilde (~) will display wherever their numeric equivalent falls, which is generally after z.\n \nRelated Topics\nClosing a Patient Record\nSetting a Default Patient List\nPatient Lists\nCover Sheet\n \n\n\n","Path::contents/Set_Default_Note_button.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/cprswt.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Set_Default_Note_button.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/cprswt.css"}],"Path::contents/Set_Default_Note_button.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Set_Default_Note_button.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Set_Default_Note_button.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Set_Default_Note_button.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Set_Default_Note_button.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Set_Default_Note_button.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Set_Default_Note_button.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Set_Default_Note_button.htm::Title":"Set Default Note button","Path::contents/Set_Default_Note_button.htm::InnerText":"\nSets the selected title in your list of titles to be the default title for this document class.\n\n\n","Path::contents/Send_MailMan_bulletin.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/cprswt.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Send_MailMan_bulletin.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/cprswt.css"}],"Path::contents/Send_MailMan_bulletin.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Send_MailMan_bulletin.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Send_MailMan_bulletin.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Send_MailMan_bulletin.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Send_MailMan_bulletin.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Send_MailMan_bulletin.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Send_MailMan_bulletin.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Send_MailMan_bulletin.htm::Title":"Send MailMan bulletin","Path::contents/Send_MailMan_bulletin.htm::InnerText":"\nChecking this box indicates a MailMan bulletin will be sent to the order's Current Provider (usually the Ordering Provider) when the order is flagged for clarification.\n\n\n","Path::contents/Setting_a_Default_Patient_List.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Setting_a_Default_Patient_List.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Review___Sign_Changes_Dialog.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Setting_a_Default_Patient_List.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Review___Sign_Changes_Dialog.htm"},{"origLink":"Patient_Lists.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Setting_a_Default_Patient_List.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Patient_Lists.htm"}],"Path::contents/Setting_a_Default_Patient_List.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Setting_a_Default_Patient_List.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Setting_a_Default_Patient_List.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Setting_a_Default_Patient_List.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Setting_a_Default_Patient_List.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Setting_a_Default_Patient_List.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Setting_a_Default_Patient_List.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Setting_a_Default_Patient_List.htm::Title":"Patient List_Setting a Default Patient List","Path::contents/Setting_a_Default_Patient_List.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Customizing,Customizing:patient list settings,Default,Default:patient list settings,list,Patient,Patient:lists,Save Patient List Settings,Setting a default:patient list","Path::contents/Setting_a_Default_Patient_List.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Setting a Default Patient List\n  \n  \n    To make it easier for you to locate your patients, CPRS enables you to set a default patient list.

Review / Sign Changes dialog allows you to simultaneously sign several orders and documents at the same time. The Review/Sign Changes option is on the File menu and brings up a dialog with the items that need a\n    signature from the current ordering session.\n  \n  \n    Sometimes during the ordering process, the status of a patient changes from outpatient to inpatient or vice versa. This might happen because an outpatient was admitted to the facility, or because an inpatient was sent to a clinic for treatment, or because of using Inpatient Medications for Outpatients (IMO) feature. When written unsigned orders exist and the patient's status changes, the user must indicate which location the orders are associated with.\n  \n  \n    To designate which location written unsigned orders are associated with, the following dialog will appear:\n  \n  \n  \n    This dialog asks to which location CPRS should associate the orders that have been placed but not signed.\n  \n  \n    The order location dialog shows the user the two locations the user can choose from, generally an outpatient clinic and an inpatient location. The user the has two basic options:\n  \n  \n    ·      Associate all of the orders with a single location by selecting the appropriate button above the list of orders. The buttons will read All\n    location\n    where location is the name of the clinic or ward location. In the above screen capture the buttons read All MICU and All Mental Health Clinic.\n  \n  \n    ·      Individually associate each order with one of the two locations. At the\n    end of each order is a column to select the location for each order.\n  \n   \n  \n    If the user is keeping the patient's chart open, such as selecting File | Review / Sign changes... and this dialog appears, the \"Where would you like to continue processing patient data?\"\n    prompt displays enabling the user to choose either the ward location or the clinic location. This prompt does not appear if the user is exiting the chart or switching patients.\n  \n   \n  \n    To sign orders and documents with the Review / Sign Changes dialog, follow these steps:\n  \n  1.     Do one of the following\n  o     Select File | Review / Sign Changes.... to sign orders or documents and stay in the current patient record.\n  o     Choose File | Select New Patient to sign orders or documents and select a new patient.\n  o     Choose File | Exit to sign orders and documents and exit CPRS.\n   \n   \n  2.     (Conditional) If CPRS displays order checks, review the order checks and take the appropriate action below:\n  \n  \n    In this screen capture, CPRS displays several possible conflicts between ordered medications. Users should review each item carefully before completing the order. If an order check is larger than the cell's available space, the user can hover\n    with the mouse to the get the full text or use the arrow keys to highlight the order check if using the keyboard or accessibility product for visually challenged users. Some order checks require an override reason. These order checks are designated by the \"*Order Check requires Reason for Override\" text in\n    red\n    and the order check text in\n    blue\n    .\n  \n   \n  a)    To redo the orders to avoid a possible interaction, select Return to Orders. This will cancel the signature process, but not the order.\n  b)    If the orders should not be placed, check the cancel check box in front of the orders that should not be placed and select Cancel Checked Order(s).\n  c)     If the possible interactions are not a problem, type a reason for override (required only for critical order checks) select Continue.\n  \n    After performing step 1 and after addressing any order checks in step 2, one of the Review/Sign Changes dialogs shown below will appear. Each item that requires a signature will have a check box in front of it.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n          \n    All non-controlled substances orders will be checked for signature when the dialog displays. To sign controlled substances orders, the user must check the box for each order individually.\n  \n  One of the following dialogs displays.\n   \n  \n  \n    This is for providers that can sign orders by policy, such as\n    nurses or clerks. If users decide to release to service, The user can select Verbal, Telephone, or Policy. Each site can choose what the default should be or if there should be a default. \n  \n   \n  \n  \n    Figure B: The Review/Sign changes dialog may have additional elements depending on the nature of the patient. In this case, the provider can sign controlled substances orders and the patient's conditions are not service-connected.\n  \n   \n  \n  \n    Figure C: In this example of the Review/Sign Changes dialog, the provider can sign controlled substance orders, and the patient has either Combat Veteran status or service-connected conditions for which the provider must i\n    ndicate the orders pertain.\n  \n   \n  3.   Deselect any items under the All Orders Except Controlled Substance Orders pane that you do not want to sign by clicking the check box to the left of the order or document.\n  \n    4.   If the Review / Sign Changes dialog is the simpler dialog, enter your electronic signature code and select\n    Sign\n    . The documents and orders will now be signed.\n  \n  \n    If the Review / Sign Changes dialog resembles Figure B or Figure C and contains question marks, continue to step 5.\n  \n  5.     To select Controlled Substance order to sign, place a check mark in the box to the left each Controlled Substance order to sign by clicking in the check box, or tabbing to it and pressing the <Space bar>.\n  \n    Note:\n     \n          \n    \n    When the user checks the box to the left of any Controlled Substance order for signature, the phrase SMART card required displays next to the label Controlled Substance Orders.\n  \n   \n  \n  This is what the dialog looks like before controlled substance outpatient orders are checked for signature.\n   \n  \n  After the controlled substances orders are checked, the text about the \"smart card required\" and the text the provider is acknowledging display.\n   \n  \n    6.    The blue question marks inside the dialog's\n    check boxes indicate that you need to specify how that order is related to the medical condition in that column. (SC = Service Connected Condition, CV=Combat Veteran, AO=Agent Orange Exposure, IR=Ionizing Radiation Exposure, SWAC=Southwest Asia Conditions, SHD=Shipboard Hazard and Defense, MST=Military Sexual Trauma, and HNC=Head or Neck Cancer). If you place a check in a box, you are indicating that a medication order is related to the condition in that column. If you create an empty box, you are indicating that the medication order is not related to the condition in that column. You must either\n    check or uncheck every box that contains a blue question mark before you can sign the order.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n     \n          \n    \n    Definitions for service\n    connection and treatment factors are available to users by hovering the cursor over the term or using the appropriate keyboard shortcut as shown in the list below:\n  \n  o     Service connection (SC)        Alt + c\n  o     Combat Veteran (CV)        Alt + v\n  o     Agent Orange (AO)         Alt + o\n  o     Ionizing Radiation (IR)        Alt + r\n  o     Southwest Asia Conditions (SWAC)       Alt + a\n  o     Shipboard Hazard and Defense (SHD)      Alt + h\n  o     Military Sexual Trauma (MST)       Alt + m\n  o     Head and/or Neck Cancer (HNC)       Alt + n\n   \n  \n    You can toggle the check boxes by:\n  \n  ·      Selecting an individual check box or tabbing to the check box and pressing the spacebar.\n  \n  \n    This will toggle the box between checked and unchecked.\n  \n   \n  ·      To check all check boxes in a column, select the button above the appropriate column.\n  \n  \n    This will toggle all the check boxes in that column.\n  \n   \n  ·      Selecting the All button.\n  \n  \n    This will toggle all the check boxes on the dialog.\n  \n   \n  7.     If you have not already done so, insert your PIV or smart card.\n  \n    Note:\n     \n         \n    \n    If you do not insert your PIV or smart  card before attempting to sign the selected Controlled Substance orders, you will see the following two dialogs:\n  \n  \n  \n   \n  \n    8.     When you have removed all of the question marks from the dialog, enter your electronic signature code (the button will change from Don't Sign to Sign) and click\n    Sign\n    .\n  \n  9.    (Conditional) If your PIV card is already set up, you will not see the Digital Signing Setup dialog and you can proceed to step 10. If your PIV or Smart card is not yet linked to your VistA account, you will need to set it up before you can sign outpatient controlled substance medication orders. To set up your PIV or smart card to order outpatient controlled substance orders, select Yes.\n  \n  You may then be asked to enter your PIN.\n  \n  Then, the signature process will proceed.\n   \n  \n    10.   If the Order Check dialog appears, deal with any problems in the dialog: such as entering a reason for override, cancelling specific orders, etc. When ready, select the\n    Accept\n    Orders\n    button.\n  \n   \n  \n    11.   When prompted, enter your PIN to sign the Controlled Substance orders and select OK or press <Enter>.\n  \n  \n  Warning:      Do NOT enter an incorrect PIN five (5) consecutive times! If you enter the incorrect PIN five (5) consecutive times, your card will be until you visit a PIV issuing station.\n  If you enter the incorrect PIN three (3) times, CPRS temporarily locks your PIV card for 15 minutes. Then, it will allow you to try again. However, you only have two (2) more attempts to get the correct PIN. If you get to five (5) consecutive incorrect PIN entries, the PIV card will be locked and you will have to go to a PIV station to unlock the card.\n   \n  \n    Criteria Used to Determine if the Copay Buttons are Displayed on the Review/Sign Changes Dialog\n  \n  \n    The Review/Sign Changes dialog may contain the Copay buttons (SC = Service Connected Condition, CV=Combat Veteran, AO=Agent Orange Exposure, IR=Ionizing Radiation Exposure, SWAC=Southwest Asia Conditions, SHD=Shipboard Hazard and Defense, MST=Military Sex\n    u\n    al Trauma, and HNC=Head or Neck Cancer) if the current patient has outpatient medication orders that need to be signed and certain additional conditions are met. The additional conditions are explained below.\n  \n  \n    Note\n    : \n           \n    \n    The Copay buttons will not appear until\n    after December 31, 2001\n    and\n    PSO*7*71 has been installed.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n           \n    \n     Previously, CPRS did not display the buttons if a veteran was 50% or more service connected. If Clinical Indicators Data Capture (CIDC) is installed and the user is\n    not\n    enabled for CIDC, the buttons display for outpatient medications regardless of the patient's level of service connection based on the criteria below.\n    The 50% criterion below does not apply with CIDC installed.\n  \n   \n  \n    ·      To qualify for the Combat Veteran (CV) exemption, the veteran must\n    have served in combat operations after the Gulf War or in combat against a hostile force after November 11, 1998. In addition, the condition for which the veteran is treated must be related to that combat, the veteran must have registered as a combat veteran, and be within two years of separation from active military service. Finally, the condition must not be already considered to be service related or that exemption should apply.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n     \n           \n    \n    The Combat Veteran exemption is valid for two years from the date of\n    separation from military service, not the registration date. For example, if a veteran registers for Combat Veteran status 18 months after the date of his or her separation, the veteran would be eligible for Combat Veteran exemption for six months only. For further details, see\n    VHA Directive 2002-049, Combat Veterans Are Eligible for Medical Services for 2-Years after Separation from Military Service Notwithstanding Lack of Evidence for Service Connection\n    .

Checks","Path::contents/Site_Defined_Clinical_Reminder_Order_Checks.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Site-Defined Clinical Reminder Order Checks\n  \n  \n    CPRS enables sites to create their own order checks based on the Clinical Reminders features. Sites will define a group of orderable items for which certain rules apply. If the rules apply to the situation, the site can define text that will display in the order check window. Sites can also set the order check to require an override.\n  \n  \n    Setting Up Clinical Reminder Order Checks\n  \n  \n    Clinical Reminder order checks are defined at the site by those who normally work on the Clinical Reminders package. The set-up of a Clinical Reminders Order Check consists of two parts:\n  \n  \n    ·      \n      This dialog prompts the user to\n     \n      insert the smart card so that they can proceed. Creating a group of orderable items to which the rules\n      should apply.\n    \n  \n  ·      Creating the rules that will be applied to the orderable item when accepting an order in CPRS. It will be possible to have the same orderable item in multiple groups. Each rule assigned to the different groups will be evaluated when placing the orderable item in CPRS. The order check groups and the rule will be stored in the Reminder Order Check file.\n   \n  \n    Rules can either be defined to run against a reminder term or a reminder definition. A reminder term is beneficial when the request is to e\n    valuate the presence of specific data (See Example #1). A reminder definition is beneficial if you need the full functionality of a reminder definition to determine if the rule should show in the order check form (See Example #2). The user setting up the\n    Clinical Reminder order check can define only one or the other.\n  \n   \n  \n    Note: \n         \n    Sites should evaluate all requests to create a Clinical Reminder Order Check to determine the importance of adding it. The more reminders that are used in an order check, the more they\n    could affect the performance of the order check system.\n  \n  \n    Example #1\n  \n  \n    Problem: An order check is needed for the interaction between timolol ophthalmic (used to treat glaucoma) and over-the-counter (OTC) antihistamines (which should not be used in the more rare narrow angle glaucoma).\n  \n  \n    Setup:\n  \n  1.     Create a reminder term that looks for the presence of a diagnosis of narrow angle glaucoma. (May need to look at multiple files depending on your site practice)\n  2.     Create an Orderable Item Group that contains all orderable items for any OTC Antihistamines.\n  3.     Create a Rule that contains the term created in step 1.\n  4.     Set the rule to trigger the order check if the reminder term is evaluated at True.\n  5.     Create the text that should appear in the order check window.\n  \n    Example of the Output in CPRS\n  \n  \n  \n    This is an example of a Clinical Reminders order check.\n  \n  \n    Description of solution: A reminder term was used in the setup because the presence of Glaucoma was a\n    ll that is needed to determine if the rule should trigger an order check. In the screen shot above, the text \"Diagnosis of Glaucoma\" was defined in the Display Name field. The rest of the text was defined in the Order Check Text field.\n  \n  \n    Example #2\n  \n  \n    Problem:\n    Order Check is needed when ordering Glyburide for patients age 65 or greater and serum Cr 2.0 or greater.\n  \n  \n    Setup:\n  \n  1.     Create a reminder definition that is applicable to the patient if the patient age is 65 or greater and the patient has a CR serum 2.0 or greater.\n  2.     Create an Orderable Item Group that contains all orderable items for the Glyburide.\n  3.     Create a Rule that contains the definition created in step 1.\n  4.     Set the rule to trigger the order check if the reminder definition is applicable to the patient.\n  5.     Create the text that should appear in the order check window. Set the order text to display the finding output in the order check text.\n  \n    Example of the output in CPRS\n  \n  \n  \n    This is an example of a Clinical Reminders order checks that uses a rule and contains part of the definition.\n  \n  \n    Description of solution: We needed a reminder definition to match patients older than 64 who had a lab test with the results greater than 2. In this example we set the rule up to display both the order check text and the definition evaluation text. The text \"Glyburide Contraindicated\" is the display name. The text \"Avoid glyburide in patients with a calculated creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min or a\n    creating 2 or greater. If an oral sulfonylurea is required, consider glipizide\" is defined by the site. The rest of the text is returned from the reminder definition evaluation.\n  \n  \n    Enabling Users to See the Reminders Order Checks\n  \n  \n    Clinical Reminder Order checks are defined with a testing field. If the order check is being tested, the Clinical Application Coordinator (CAC) or similar person sets this field in the Clinical Reminders order check definition to True. Then, only users who have the Clinical Reminder\n    Test order check set to Yes will receive the order check--allowing a small number of users to test the order check before it is enabled for all users in the facility.\n  \n  \n    Related topics\n  \n  Order Checking Overview\n  Order Checking Local\n  Order Checking Remote\n  Ordering a Diet\n  Ordering Inpatient Medications (Simple Dose)\n  Ordering Inpatient Medications (Complex Dose)\n  Ordering Outpatient Medications (Simple Dose)\n  Ordering Outpatient Medications (Complex Dose)\n  Ordering IV Fluids\n  Ordering Lab Tests\n  Ordering Radiology and Imaging Procedures\n  Ordering a Consult\n  Ordering Vitals\n  Text Only Orders\n  Event-Delayed Orders\n   \n\n","Path::contents/Sort_Order.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/cprswt.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Sort_Order.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/cprswt.css"}],"Path::contents/Sort_Order.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Sort_Order.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Sort_Order.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Sort_Order.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Sort_Order.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Sort_Order.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Sort_Order.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Sort_Order.htm::Title":"Sort Order","Path::contents/Sort_Order.htm::InnerText":"\nPatients will be displayed sorted by this selection.

number of orders and sign them all simultaneously. However, you cannot sign documents with this command.\n  \n  \n    Sometimes during the ordering process, the status of a patient changes from outpatient to inpatient or vice versa. This might happen because an outpatient was admitted to the facility, or because an inpatient was sent to a clinic for treatment, or because of using Inpatient Medications for Outpatients (IMO) feature. When written unsigned orders exist and the patient's status changes, the user must indicate which location the orders are associated with.\n  \n  \n    Users designate which location the written unsigned orders are associated with in the Order Location dialog.\n  \n  \n    The order location dialog shows the user the two locations the user can choose from, generally an outpatient clinic and an inpatient location.\n    The user has two basic options:\n  \n  \n    ·      Associate All of the orders with a single location by selecting the appropriate button above the list of orders. The buttons will read All\n    location\n    where location is the name of the clinic or ward location. In the above screen capture the buttons read All MICU and All Mental Health Clinic.\n  \n  \n    ·      Individually associate each order with\n    one of the two locations. At the end of each order is a column to select the location for each order.\n  \n   \n  \n    If the user is keeping the patient's chart open, such as selecting File | Review / Sign changes... and this dialog appears, the \"Where would you like to continue processing patient data?\" prompt displays enabling the user to choose either the ward location or the clinic location. This prompt does not appear if the user is exiting the chart or switching patients.\n  \n   \n  \n    To sign a number of orders, use these steps:\n  \n  \n    1.     Select the\n    Orders\n    tab.\n  \n  2.     Highlight the orders you want to sign.\n  \n    To select a range of items, click the order at the beginning of the range; then hold down the\n    SHIFT\n    key and click the order at the end of the range.

Users should review each item carefully before completing the order. If an order check is larger than the cell's available space, the user can hover with the mouse to the get the full text or use the arrow keys to highlight the order check if using the keyboard or accessibility product for visually challenged users. Some order checks require an override reason. These order checks are designated\n    by the \"*Order Check requires Reason for Override\" text in\n    red\n    and the order check text in\n    blue\n    .\n  \n   \n  a)     To redo the orders to avoid a possible interaction, select Return to Orders.

Each item that requires a signature will have a check box in front of it.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n         \n    All non-controlled substances orders will be checked for signature when the dialog displays. To sign controlled substances orders, the user must check the box for each order individually.\n  \n  \n    Then, one of the following dialogs displays.\n  \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n    Figure B: The Review/Sign changes dialog may have additional elements depending on the nature of the patient. In this case, the provider can sign controlled substances orders and the patient's conditions are not service-connected.\n  \n   \n  \n  \n    Figure C: In this example of the Review/Sign Changes dialog, the provider can sign controlled substance orders, and the patient has either Combat Veteran status or service-connected conditions for which the\n    provider must indicate the orders pertain.\n  \n  \n    5.     \n      If the simpler Electronic Signature dialog displays, select or deselect orders as needed and then enter your electronic signature code (if necessary) and select Sign.

(SC = Service Connected Condition, CV=Combat Veteran, AO=Agent Orange Exposure, IR=Ionizing Radiation Exposure, SWAC=Southwest Asia Conditions, SHD=Shipboard Hazard and Defense, MST=Military Sexual Trauma, and HNC=Head or Neck Cancer). If you place a check in a box, you are indicating that a medication order\n    is\n    related to the condition in that column. If you create an empty box, you are indicating that the medication order is\n    not\n    related to the condition in that column.\n    You must either check or uncheck every box that contains a blue question mark before you can sign the order.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n     \n         \n    Definitions for service connection and treatment factors are available to users\n    by hovering the cursor over the term or using the appropriate keyboard shortcut as shown in the list below:\n  \n  o     Service connection (SC)   Alt + c\n  o     Combat Veteran (CV)   Alt + v\n  o     Agent Orange (AO)    Alt + o\n  o     Ionizing Radiation (IR)   Alt + r\n  o     Southwest Asia Conditions (SWAC)  Alt + a\n  o     Shipboard Hazard and Defense (SHD) Alt + h\n  o     Head and/or Neck Cancer (HNC)  Alt + n\n   \n  \n    You can toggle the check boxes by:\n  \n  o     \n    Selecting an individual check box.\n  \n  \n    This will toggle the box between checked and unchecked.\n  \n  o     \n    To select all the check boxes in one column, press the button above the appropriate column (SC = Service Connected Condition, CV=Combat Veteran, AO=Agent Orange Exposure, IR=Ionizing Radiation Exposure, SWAC=Southwest Asia Conditions, SHD=Shipboard Hazard and Defense, MST=Military Sexual Trauma, and HNC=Head or Neck Cancer).\n  \n  \n    This will toggle all the check boxes in that column.\n  \n  o     \n    To check all check boxes on the dialog, press the All button.\n  \n  \n    This will toggle all the check boxes on the screen.\n  \n   \n  8.     To select Controlled Substance order to sign, place a check mark in the box to the left each Controlled Substance order to sign by clicking in the check box, or tabbing to it and pressing the <Space bar>.\n  \n    Note:\n         When the user checks the box to the left of any Controlled Substance order for signature, the phrase \"SMART card required\" displays next to the label Controlled Substance Orders.\n  \n   \n  9.     If you have not already done so, insert your PIV or smart  card.\n  \n    Note:\n     \n        \n    If you do not insert your PIV or smart card before attempting to sign the selected Controlled Substance orders, you will see the following two dialogs:\n  \n   \n  \n   \n  \n  \n    10.  \n      When you have removed all of the question marks from the dialog, enter your electronic signature code (the button will change\n      from Don't Sign to Sign) and click\n      Sign\n      .\n    \n  \n  11.   (Conditional) If your PIV card is already set up, you will not see the Digital Signing Setup dialog and you can proceed to step 11. If your PIV or Smart card is not yet linked to your VistA account, you will need to set it up before you can sign outpatient controlled substance medication orders. To set up your PIV or smart card to order outpatient controlled substance orders, select Yes.\n  \n  You may then be asked to enter your PIN.\n  \n  Then, the signature process will proceed.\n   \n  \n    12.   If the Order Check dialog appears, deal with any problems in the dialog: such as entering a reason for override, cancelling specific orders, etc. When ready, select the\n    Accept\n    Orders\n    button.\n  \n   \n  \n    13.   When prompted, enter your PIN to sign the Controlled Substance orders and select OK or press <Enter>.\n  \n  \n  Warning:      Do NOT enter an incorrect PIN five (5) consecutive times! If you enter the incorrect PIN five (5) consecutive times, your card will be until you visit a PIV issuing station.\n  If you enter the incorrect PIN three (3) times, CPRS temporarily locks your PIV or smart card for 15 minutes. Then, it will allow you to try again. However, you only have two (2) more attempts to get the correct PIN.

enable users to decide which of their Notifications or Alerts they would like to process first, the format for displaying Notifications in the CPRS GUI has been changed to columns that enable users to sort their Notifications based on column heading\n    :\n  \n  ·      Info (information alerts are preceded with an \"I\")\n  ·      Patient name (alphabetical or reverse alphabetical)\n  ·      Location (patient location, if known, alphabetical or reverse alphabetical)\n  ·      Urgency (valued HIGH, Moderate, or low as indicated by the CPRS parameter ORB URGENCY. TIU alerts are given a Moderate urgency value. Other alerts without a parameter value are given an urgency of low.)\n  ·      Alert Date/Time (date/time the alert was triggered, newest to oldest or oldest to newest)\n  ·      Message (alert message or text, alphabetical or reverse alphabetical)\n  ·      Forwarded By/When (sorts alerts alphabetically and then by time for the same forwarding person)\n   \n  \n    Clicking a heading will sort the alerts by that heading.\n  \n   \n  \n    Sorting Notification Columns\n    Using the Mouse\n  \n  \n    To sort Notifications using the mouse, click the column heading you want to sort by. To reverse the sort order, click the same heading again. For example, a user could decide to sort by date and time. Normally, the most recent alerts are listed first. The user could click the column heading to reverse the order and have the oldest alerts displayed first. Clicking the column heading again would list the most recent alerts first.\n  \n  \n    Sorting Notifications Using the Keyboard\n  \n  \n    Users who do not use t\n    he mouse can sort Notifications in ascending order (alphabetical order or most recent Date/Time) using the keyboard only. When users sort using the Ctrl + <key> combination, CPRS will recognize either upper or lower case letters (this feature is not case-sensitive). Users can sort Notifications using the following Ctrl + <key> combinations:\n  \n   \n  \n    Key Combination Column Sorted\n  \n  \n     \n    Ctrl + I Info\n  \n  \n     \n    Ctrl + P Patient\n  \n  \n     \n    Ctrl + L Location\n  \n  \n     \n    Ctrl + U Urgency\n  \n  \n     \n    Ctrl + D Alert Date/Time \n  \n  \n     \n    Ctrl + M Message\n  \n  \n     \n    Ctrl + F \n    Forwarded By/When\n  \n   \n  \n    Note:\n          A limitation exists in the programming environment that does not allow the user to user the same key combination to then reverse the sort. Making this change would not be trivial and will not be addressed the CPRS GUI at this time.\n  \n   \n  \n    Viewing Comments of Forwarded Alerts\n  \n  \n    Users may also want to view comments associated with forwarded alerts. To view a comment, simply place the cursor over the alert, leave it still for a few seconds, and the comment will display. Move the mouse and the\n    comment will no longer be displayed.\n  \n  \n  \n    This graphic shows that when you place the cursor over a forwarded alert the associated comment will display.\n  \n   \n  \n    To bring up the forwarded comment in a separate dialog, highlight the notification with\n    the comment and select the Show Comment button.\n  \n   \n  \n    Related topics\n  \n  \n      Notifications and Alerts\n    \n  \n      Removing Notifications\n    \n  \n      Forwarding Notifications\n    \n  Processing Notifications\n  Deferring Notifications\n   \n\n","Path::contents/Source_Combinations.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/cprswt.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Source_Combinations.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/cprswt.css"}],"Path::contents/Source_Combinations.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Source_Combinations.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Source_Combinations.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Source_Combinations.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Source_Combinations.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Source_Combinations.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Source_Combinations.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Source_Combinations.htm::Title":"Source Combinations","Path::contents/Source_Combinations.htm::InnerText":"\nEdit the criteria for a patient list composed from multiple sources.\n\n\n","Path::contents/SMART_Features.htm::Links":[],"Path::contents/SMART_Features.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/SMART_Features.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/SMART_Features.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/SMART_Features.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/SMART_Features.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/SMART_Features.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/SMART_Features.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/SMART_Features.htm::Title":"SMART_Features","Path::contents/SMART_Features.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"SMART","Path::contents/SMART_Features.htm::InnerText":"\nSMART \n Features\nSMART enhances the ability to track and manage mammography \n results.

a user leaves a patient chart whether\n    to select a new patient or to exit CPRS completely, CPRS prompts the user to sign unsigned orders that the user has privileges to sign. The dialog that CPRS displays may be different than the Review/Sign Changes… or Sign Selected dialogs based on the par\n    a\n    meter settings. By changing the parameters settings, the dialog may display one or more of the following categories of unsigned orders:\n  \n  ·      My Unsigned Orders - This Session\n  ·      My Unsigned Orders - Previous Sessions\n  \n    ·      Others'\n    Unsigned Orders - All Sessions\n  \n   \n  \n    Sometimes during the ordering process, the status of a patient changes from outpatient to inpatient or vice versa. This might happen because an outpatient was admitted to the facility, or because an inpatient was sent to a clinic for treatment, or because\n    of using Inpatient Medications for Outpatients (IMO) feature. When written unsigned orders exist and the patient's status changes, the user must indicate which location the orders are associated with.\n  \n  \n    To designate which location written unsigned orders are\n    associated with, the following dialog will appear:\n  \n  \n  \n    This dialog asks to which location CPRS should associate the orders that have been placed but not signed.\n  \n   \n  \n    The order location dialog shows the user the two locations the user can choose\n    from, generally an outpatient clinic and an inpatient location. The user has two basic options:\n  \n  \n    · \n        \n    Associate All of the orders with a single location by selecting the appropriate button above the list of orders. The buttons will read All\n    location\n    where location is the name of the clinic or ward location. In the above screen capture the buttons read All MICU and All Mental Health Clinic.\n  \n  ·     Individually associate each order with one of the two locations. At the end of each order is a column to select the location for each order.\n   \n  \n    If the user selects File | Review / Sign changes... and this dialog appears, the \"Where would you like to continue processing patient data?\" prompt displays enabling the user to choose either the ward location or the clinic location. This prompt does not appear if the user is exiting the chart or switching patients.\n  \n  \n    To sign a number of orders, use these steps:\n  \n  \n    1.\n        \n     Select the\n    Orders\n    tab.\n  \n  2.     Highlight the orders you want to sign.\n  \n    To select a range of items, click the order at the beginning\n    of the range; then hold down the <\n    Shift\n    > key and click the order at the end of the range. To select multiple, individual orders, select the first order, hold down the\n    CTRL\n    key, and click the next order.\n  \n   \n  \n    3.     Select\n    Action | Sign Selected...\n  \n  \n    -or-\n  \n  \n    right-click and select\n    Sign...\n  \n   \n  4.     (Conditional) If CPRS displays order checks, review the order checks and take the appropriate action below:\n  \n  \n    In this screen capture, CPRS displays several possible conflicts between ordered medications. Users should review each item carefully before completing the order. If an order check is larger than the cell's available space, the user can hover with the mouse to the get the full text or use the arrow keys to highlight the order check if using the keyboard or accessibility product for visually challenged users. Some order checks require an override reason. These order checks are designated by the \"*Order Check requires Reason for Override\" text in\n    red\n    and the order check text in\n    blue\n    .\n  \n   \n  a)    To redo the orders to avoid a possible interaction, select Return to Orders. This will cancel the signature process, but not the order.\n  b)    If the orders should not be placed, check the cancel check box in front of the orders that should not be placed and select Cancel Checked Order(s).\n  c)     If the possible interactions are not a problem, type a reason for override (required only for critical order checks) select Continue.\n  \n    After performing step 1 and after addressing any order checks in step 2, one of the Review/Sign Changes\n    dialogs shown below will appear. Each item that requires a signature will have a check box in front of it.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n          All non-controlled substances orders will be checked for signature when the dialog displays. To sign controlled substances orders, the user must check the box for each order individually.\n  \n  \n    One of the following signature dialogs will display.\n  \n  \n   \n  \n   \n  \n  \n    Figure B: The Review/Sign changes dialog may have additional elements depending on the nature of the patient. In this case, the provider can sign controlled substances orders and the patient's conditions are not service-connected.\n  \n   \n  \n  \n    Figur\n    e C: In this example of the Review/Sign Changes dialog, the provider can sign controlled substance orders, and the patient has either Combat Veteran status or service-connected conditions for which the provider must indicate the orders pertain.\n  \n   \n   \n  \n    5.     If the Electronic Signature dialog resembles Figure A, enter your electronic signature code (if necessary) and click\n    Sign\n    .\n    The orders will now be signed.\n  \n  \n    If the Review / Sign Changes dialog resembles Figure B or Figure C and contains question marks, cont\n    inue to step 6.\n  \n  6.     To select Controlled Substance order to sign, place a check mark in the box to the left each Controlled Substance order to sign by clicking in the check box, or tabbing to it and pressing the <Space bar>.\n  \n    Note:\n     \n          \n    \n    When the user checks the box to the left of any Controlled Substance order for signature, the phrase SMART card required displays next to the label Controlled Substance Orders.\n  \n   \n  \n  This is what the dialog looks like before controlled substance outpatient orders are checked for signature.\n   \n  \n  After the controlled substances orders are checked, the text about the \"smart card required\" and the text the provider is acknowledging display.\n   \n  \n    7.     The question marks inside the check boxes in Figure B indicate that you need to specify how that order is related to the medical condition in that column. (SC = Service Connected Condition, CV=Combat Veteran, AO=Agent Orange Exposure, IR=Ionizing Radiation Exposure, SWAC=Southwest Asia Conditions, SHD=Shipboard Hazard and Defense, MST=Military Sexual Trauma, and HNC=Head and/or Neck Cancer). If you place a check in a box, you are indicating that a medication order\n    is\n    related to the condition in that column. If you create an empty box, you are indicating that the medication order is\n    not\n    related to the condition in that column.\n    You must either check or uncheck every box that contains a question mark before you can sign the order.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n          Definitions for service connection and treatment factors are available to users by hovering the cursor over the term or using the appropriate keyboard shortcut as shown in the list below:\n  \n  o     Service connection (SC)   Alt + c\n  o     Combat Veteran (CV)   Alt + v\n  o     Agent Orange (AO)    Alt + o\n  o     Ionizing Radiation (IR)   Alt + r\n  o     Southwest Asia Conditions (SWAC)  Alt + a\n  o     Shipboard Hazard and Defense (SHD) Alt + h\n  o     Military Sexual Trauma (MST)  Alt + m\n  o     Head and/or Neck Cancer (HNC)  Alt + n\n   \n   \n  \n    You can toggle t\n    he check boxes by:\n  \n  o     \n    Selecting an individual check box or tabbing to the check box and pressing the spacebar.\n  \n  \n    This will toggle the box between checked and unchecked.\n  \n   \n  o     \n    To check all check boxes in a column, select the button above the appropriate column.\n  \n  \n    Thi\n    s will toggle all the check boxes in that column.\n  \n   \n  o     \n    Selecting the All button.\n  \n  \n    This will toggle all the check boxes on the dialog.\n  \n   \n  \n    8.     To select Controlled Substance order to sign, place a check\n    mark in the box to the left each Controlled Substance order to sign by clicking in the check box, or tabbing to it and pressing the <Space bar>.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n         When the user checks the box to the left of any Controlled Substance order for signature, the phrase \"SMART card required\" displays next to the label Controlled Substance Orders.\n  \n   \n  9.     If you have not already done so, insert your PIV or smart card.\n  \n    Note:\n     \n         \n    If you do not insert your PIV or smart card before attempting to sign the selected Controlled Substance orders, you will see\n    the following two dialogs:\n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n    10.   When you have removed all of the question marks from the dialog, enter your electronic signature code (the button will change from Don't Sign to Sign) and click\n    Sign\n    .\n  \n  11.  (Conditional) If your PIV or smart card is already set up, you will not see the Digital Signing Setup dialog and you can proceed to step 11. If your PIV or smart card is not yet linked to your VistA account, you will need to set it up before you can sign outpatient controlled substance medication orders. To set up your PIV or smart card to order outpatient controlled substance orders, select Yes.\n  \n  You may then be asked to enter your PIN.\n  \n  Then, the signature process will proceed.\n   \n  \n    12.   If the Order Check dialog appears, deal with any problems in the dialog: such as entering a reason for override, cancelling specific orders, etc. When ready, select the\n    Accept\n    Orders\n    button.\n  \n   \n  \n    13.   When prompted, enter your PIN to sign the Controlled Substance orders and select OK or press <Enter>.\n  \n  \n  Warning:      Do NOT enter an incorrect PIN five (5) consecutive times! If you enter the incorrect PIN five (5) consecutive times, your card will be until you visit a PIV issuing station.\n  If you enter the incorrect PIN three (3) times, CPRS temporarily locks your PIV or smart card for 15 minutes. Then, it will allow you to try again. However, you only have two (2) more attempts to get the correct PIN. If you get to five (5) consecutive incorrect PIN entries, the PIV card will be locked and you will have to go to a PIV station to unlock the card.\n   \n   \n  Related topics\n  \n      Understanding Service Connection and Treatment Factors\n    \n  \n      Digital Signature (PKI) Overview\n    \n  \n      Electronic Signature (overview)\n    \n  \n      Sign Selected\n      Orders Command\n    \n  \n      Sign Note Now and Sign Discharge Summary Now Commands\n    \n  \n      Add to Signature List\n    \n  \n      Viewing Unsigned Notes or Discharge Summaries\n    \n  \n      Identify Additional Signers\n    \n  CIDC: Entering Diagnosis Codes for Specific Orders\n   \n\n","Path::contents/Team_Personal.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/cprswt.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Team_Personal.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/cprswt.css"}],"Path::contents/Team_Personal.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Team_Personal.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Team_Personal.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Team_Personal.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Team_Personal.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Team_Personal.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Team_Personal.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Team_Personal.htm::Title":"Team/Personal","Path::contents/Team_Personal.htm::InnerText":"\nEnter the default Team or Personal List for patient selection.

The Orderable Item for the selected drug is automatically added to the order, and all dispense drugs entered for the order must be linked to that Orderable Item. If the Orderable Item is edited, data in the DOSAGE ORDERED and DISPENSE DRUG fields will be deleted. If multiple dispense drugs are needed in an order, they may be entered by selecting the DISPENSE DRUG field (#10) from the edit list before accepting the new order (see either the Inpatient Medications Nurses' or Pharmacists Manual for more information on this process). After each dispense drug is selected, it will be checked against the patient's current medications for duplicate drug or class orders, and drug-drug/drug-allergy interactions (see either the Inpatient Medications Nurses' or Pharmacists Manual for more information on this process).\nNote:      For IV order entry, you must bypass the \"Select DRUG:\" prompt in the Inpatient Order Entry option (by pressing the Return key) and then choose the IV type at the \"Select IV TYPE:\" prompt.\n \nDosage Ordered\nTo allow pharmacy greater control over the order display shown for Unit Dose orders on profiles, labels, MARs, etc., the DOSAGE ORDERED field is no longer required. If no DOSAGE ORDERED is defined for an order, the order will be displayed as follows:\nDISPENSE DRUG NAME\nGive: UNITS/DOSE MEDICATION ROUTE SCHEDULE\n \nIf DOSAGE ORDERED is defined for the order, it will be displayed as:\nORDERABLE ITEM NAME DOSE FORM\nGive: DOSAGE ORDERED MEDICATION ROUTE SCHEDULE\nNote:      If an order contains multiple DISPENSE DRUGS, DOSAGE ORDERED will be required, and should contain the total dosage of the medication to be administered.\n \nUnits Per Dose\nThis is the number of units (tablets, capsules, etc.) of the dispense drug selected to be given when the order is administered. If no data is entered, the UNITS PER DOSE is assumed to be 1.\n \nMed Route\nThis is the route of administration to be used for the order. If a default Medication Route is identified for the selected Orderable Item, it will be used as the default for the order.\n \nSchedule Type\nThis defines the type of schedule to be used when administering the order. If the schedule type entered is one time, the order's start and stop dates must be the same. When a new order is entered or an order entered through CPRS is finished by pharmacy the default Schedule Type is determined as described below:\n·      If a schedule type is defined for the Orderable Item selected, that schedule type is used for the order.\n·      If no schedule type has been found and if no schedule is defined, schedule type is CONTINUOUS.\n·      If no schedule type has been found and the schedule contains PRN, the schedule type is PRN.\n·      If no schedule type has been found and the schedule entered is found in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1), and a schedule type is defined for it, that schedule type is used for the order.\n·      If no schedule type has been found and the schedule is \"NOW\", \"STAT\", \"ONCE\", or \"ONE-TIME\" the schedule type is ONCE.\n·      If the schedule type determined above is DAY OF WEEK the schedule type is set to CONTINUOUS.\n·      If no schedule type was determined above, the schedule type is CONTINUOUS.\n \nSchedule\nThis defines the frequency the order is to be administered. Schedules may be selected from the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) or day-of-week or admin/time schedules may be used. Unit Dose recognizes schedules in the following formats:\n·      QxH - Hourly schedules where x is the number of hours between administrations\n·      QxD - Daily schedules where x is the number of days between administrations\n·      QxM - Monthly schedules where x is the number of months between administrations\n \nIf a schedule is defined for the Orderable Item selected when entering a new order, that schedule is displayed as the default for the order.\n \nAdministration Times\nThis defines the time(s) of day the order is to be given. If the schedule for the order contains \"PRN\" any administration times for the order will be ignored. In new order entry the default administration times are determined as described below:\n·      If administration times are defined for the Orderable Item selected, they will be shown as the default for the order.\n·      If administration times are defined in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) for the patient's ward and the order's schedule, they will be shown as the default for the order.\n·      If administration times are defined for the Schedule, they will be shown as the default for the order.\n \nProvider\nThis identifies the provider who authorized the order. Only users identified as providers who are authorized to write medication orders may be selected.\n \nSelf Med\nIdentifies the order as to be given for administration by the patient. This prompt is only shown if the 'SELF MED' IN ORDER ENTRY field of the INPATIENT WARD PARAMETERS file (#59.6) is set to on.\n \nNature of Order\nThis specifies how the order originated. An order can be specified as written on the chart, telephoned, or verbal.

Treatment Factors\n  \n  \n    Upon electronic signature, providers will need to deal with the various exemptions for copayment for qualified veterans. To help providers better understand service connection and treatment factors, the following in\n    formation is provided.\n  \n  \n    Service Connected\n  \n  \n    The assignment of service connected percentage and disability code is based on the degree of disability as determined by the rating board decision following the submission of a claim that a veteran's illness or injury was incurred in or aggravated by military service.\n  \n  \n    An\n    adjunct condition\n    , although not service connected, is medically determined to be associated with or is aggravating a disease or condition, which is service connected. A veteran is eligible to rece\n    ive treatment for an adjunct condition; however, because the adjunct is not a condition that is specifically rated, VA can bill the insurance carrier as well as those veterans responsible for copayments for treatment provided for the adjunct condition.\n  \n  \n    A\n    secondary condition\n    is defined as a condition that has been caused or is the result of a service-connected condition. This condition is also nonservice-connected and treatment provided is also billable.\n  \n  \n    It is important that the clinician be aware of the\n    patient's service-connected conditions. This information is available by clicking the patient's name in the blue square in the upper left corner in CPRS. It is also found on the encounter form. If a patient is being treated for a service-connected condition during a visit, the provider should check the service-connected box on the encounter form \"yes\".\n  \n  \n    Compensable service-connected veterans are not charged an outpatient copayment. However, nonservice-connected veterans and veterans rated less than 50\n    % service-connected with income above the existing threshold may be charged a medication copayment if the medication is for a nonservice-connected condition. If the veteran has health insurance, a claim will be submitted to the insurance carr\n    ier for the t\n    reatment of nonservice-connected conditions.\n  \n  \n    Treatment Factors/Environmental Indicators\n  \n  \n    The provider must make a clinical decision to determine if an encounter is for a SC condition or one of a number of special categories.\n    If the veteran is being treated\n    during the encounter for a condition that the provider believes is for SC or a special category, the provider should check \"Yes\" next to the appropriate category on the encounter form. The veteran will not be billed for the encounter if \"Yes\" is checked.\n  \n  \n    Medication(s) for one of these conditions should be indicated during the outpatient medication ordering process. The veteran will not be charged a copayment for a medication that is for SC or a special category.\n  \n  \n    The Special Categories included are:\n  \n  \n    · \n        Combat Veteran (CV)\n  \n  \n    · \n        Agent Orange (AO)\n  \n  \n    · \n        Ionizing Radiation (IR)\n  \n  \n    · \n        Southwest Asia Conditions (SWAC)\n    –\n    includes Gulf War veterans\n  \n  \n    · \n        Shipboard Hazard and Defense (SHD)\n  \n  \n    · \n        Military Sexual Trauma (MST)\n  \n  \n    · \n        Head and Neck Cancer (HNC)\n    , after nasopharyngeal radium treatment in service.\n  \n  \n    · \n        Camp Lejeune (CL)\n  \n   \n   \n  \n    Combat Veteran\n  \n  \n    Overview of Combat Veteran Status\n  \n  \n    To qualify for the Combat Veteran (CV) exemption, the ve\n    teran must have served in combat operations after the Gulf War or in combat against a hostile force after November 11, 1998. In addition, the condition for which the veteran is treated must be related to that combat, the veteran must have registered as a\n    c\n    ombat veteran, and be within two years of separation from active military service. Finally, the condition must not be already considered to be service related or that exemption should apply.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n         The Combat Veteran exemption is valid for two years from the date of separation from military service, not the registration date. For example, if a veteran registers for Combat Veteran status 18 months after the date of his or her separation, the veteran would be eligible for Combat Veteran exemption for six months only. For further details, see VHA Directive 2002-049, Combat Veterans Are Eligible for Medical Services for 2-Years after Separation from Military Service Notwithstanding Lack of Evidence for Service Connection.\n  \n  \n    Combat Veteran Markers\n  \n  \n    To help users better identify Combat Veteran eligible patients so that appropriate care and prioritization occur for them, CPRS has added several items where Combat Veteran status is more clearly shown. This is especially true in Consults. These markers are shown in various places in CPRS, such as the Patient Selection screen, the buttons available from any tab, the Consults dialog and details, the SF-513 form, etc.\n  \n  \n    ·      \n    Patient Selection Screen:\n    When the user selects a patient with Combat Veteran status, CPRS indicates that patient is a combat veteran by displaying the letters CV and a date below the normal demographic information on the Patient Selection screen and above the Save Patient List Settings button. The marker is shown in the screen capture\n    below surrounded by a red box.\n  \n  \n   \n  \n    ·      \n    New Service Consult/Request Notifications:\n    The lower portion of the Patient Selection screen is the list of notifications for the user that is logged in. For a new consult or procedure request for a veteran with Combat Veteran status, the letters CV and the date display behind the abbreviated patient identifier in the Patient column. The Combat Veteran notification marker is shown in the above screen capture outlined in red.\n  \n  \n    ·      \n    Combat Veteran Button and Consult Details:\n    Available from any CPRS tab, the Combat Veteran button displays the letters CV and the expiration date of Combat Veteran Status. The Button displays when the selected patient has Combat Veteran status. The button shares space with the Flag\n    button. The Combat Veteran button only displays for patients with the status, otherwise, the Flag button is whole.\n  \n  o     To get details, the user selects the button to display the Combat Veteran Details dialog. See Combat Veteran Details Dialog below.\n  o     When the user selects the consults from the treeview, the consults details show in the pane to the right. In this view, the Combat Veteran status is shown underneath the primary eligibility.\n  \n   \n   \n  \n    · \n        \n    Combat Veteran Details Dialog:\n    When the user selects the Combat Veteran button, the Combat Veteran Details dialog displays with the following items:\n  \n  o     Service Branch\n  o     Status\n  o     Separation Date\n  o     Expiration Date\n  o     OEF/OIF (If the patient served in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) or Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)\n  \n   \n  \n    · \n        \n    Consult Order Dialog:\n    The Combat Veteran status and expiration date display near the top of the Consult Order dialog.\n  \n  \n   \n   \n  \n    ·      \n    SF-513 Form:\n    Several changes were made to this form:\n  \n  o     At the top of the page on the SF-513, the Combat Veteran marker displays with the demographic information.\n  o     The patient's name was moved to the top of this form.\n  o     When printed, the patient's identifying information will be printed at the top of each page.\n  o     When printed, a page number will be printed at the bottom of each page.\n  \n   \n   \n  \n    Agent Orange\n  \n  \n    Agent Orange (AO) is\n    an herbicide that was used in Vietnam between 1962 and 1971 to remove unwanted plant life that provided cover for enemy forces.  The VA has recognized the following conditions as associated with but not necessarily caused by exposure to Agent Orange:\n  \n  \n    \n      AL Amylodosis\n    \n    \n      Diabetes (type 2)\n    \n    \n      Chloracne or other acneform disease consistent with chloracne (must occur within one year of exposure to AO).\n    \n    \n      Ischemic Heart Disease\n    \n    \n      Parkinson’s Disease\n    \n    \n      Porphyria cutanea tarda (must occur within one year of exposure to AO).\n    \n    \n      Acute and subacute peripheral neuropathy. (For purposes of this section, the term acute and subacute peripheral neuropathy means temporary peripheral neuropathy that appears within weeks or months of exposure to an herbicide agent and resolves within two years of the date of onset.)\n    \n    \n      Numerous cancers:\n    \n    \n      \n        \n          Prostate cancer\n        \n        \n          Hodgkin's disease\n        \n        \n          Multiple myeloma\n        \n        \n          Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma\n        \n        \n          Respiratory cancers (cancer of the lung, bronchus, larynx, or trachea). (Must occur within 30 years of exposure to Agent Orange.)\n        \n        \n          Soft-tissue sarcoma (other than osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, or mesothelioma).\n        \n        \n          Chronic lymphocytic leukemia\n        \n      \n    \n  \n   \n  \n    Ionizing Radiation\n  \n  \n    Atomic veterans may have been exposed to ionizing radiation in a variety of ways at various locations. Veterans exposed at a\n    nuclear device testing site (the Pacific Islands, e.g., Bikini, NM, NV, etc.) or in Hiroshima and/or Nagasaki, Japan, may be included. Atomic veterans with exposure to ionizing radiation are entitled to receive treatment for conditions for this exposure.\n    VA has recognized the following conditions by statute or regulation as being associated with radiation exposure:\n  \n  \n    Conditions Associated with Ionizing Radiation:\n  \n  ·      All cancers/malignancies\n  ·      Posterior subcapsular cataracts\n  \n    ·      Non-malignant thyroid nodular\n    disease\n  \n  ·      Parathyroid adenoma\n  ·      Tumors of the brain and central nervous system\n  \n    Note:\n          Atomic veterans do not have to receive an Ionizing Radiation Registry Exam to have these special treatment eligibilities.\n  \n   \n  \n    Southwest Asia Conditions\n  \n  \n    Gulf War veterans were exposed to a wide variety of environmental hazards and potential harmful substances during their service in Southwest Asia. These include depleted uranium, pesticides, the anti-nerve gas pill pyridostigmine bromide, infectious dis\n    e\n    ases, chemical and biological warfare agents, and vaccinations (including anthrax and botulinum toxoid), and oil well free smoke and petroleum products. VA recognizes that there are other health risk factors encountered by Gulf War veterans. Veterans wit\n    h\n    service during the Gulf War are entitled to receive treatment for conditions for this service\n    .\n  \n  \n    If the treatment provided during the encounter is for an illness or symptom that may possibly be associated with environmental contamination this should be i\n    ndicated on the encounter form or medication order\n  \n  \n    Conditions Associated with Southwest Asia Conditions:\n  \n  ·      Persistent fatigue\n  ·      Skin rash\n  ·      Headache\n  ·      Arthralgias/myalgias\n  ·      Sleep disturbance\n  ·      Forgetfulness\n  ·      Joint pain\n  ·      Shortness of breath/chest pain\n  ·      Feverishness\n  ·      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis\n   \n  \n    Shipboard Hazard and Defense\n  \n  \n    Veterans with conditions recognized by VA as associated with Project 112/ SHAD, shipboard and land-based biological and chemical testing conducted by\n    the United States (U.S.) military between 1962 and 1973 are eligible for enrollment in priority group 6, unless eligible for enrollment in a higher priority. In addition, veterans receive care at no charge for care and medications provided for treatment\n    o\n    f conditions related to exposure.\n  \n   \n  \n    Military Sexual Trauma\n  \n  \n    VA is authorized by law to provide counseling services to women and men veterans who experienced incidents of sexual trauma while they served on active duty in the military.\n    This Law d\n    efines a sexual trauma as sexual harassment, sexual assault, rape and other acts of violence. It further defines sexual harassment as repeated unsolicited, verbal or physical contact of a sexual nature, which is threatening in nature.\n  \n  \n    The provider must mak\n    e a clinical decision to determine if a visit or medication is for MST.\n    If the veteran is being treated for any condition during this episode of care that the provider believes is for MST; the visit should be checked as related on the encounter form and t\n    he medication should be designated as for MST. This will mean that the veteran does not have to pay a copayment for the visit or the medication.\n  \n   \n  \n    Head and Neck Cancer\n  \n  \n    Veterans with cancer of the head and neck and a history of receipt of Nasopharyngeal (NP) radium therapy are eligible to receive treatment. There are very specific dates and locations where this activity occurred. Eligibility for this special class needs to be verified by HAS. (Not all veterans receiving head and neck cancer treatment fall into this treatment category.)\n  \n  \n    During the 1920s, nasopharyngeal (NP) radium therapy was developed to treat hearing loss caused by repeated ear infections. Radium-tipped rods were inserted into the nostrils and left in place for several minut\n    es. Military physicians used NP radium to treat aerotitis media (barotrauma) in submariners, aviators, and divers. It is estimated that between 8,000 and 20,000 military personnel received NP radium treatments during World War II and until the 1960s. Vet\n    e\n    rans also included are those with documentation of NP radium treatment in active military, naval or air service; those who served as an aviator in the active military, naval or air service before the end of the Korean conflict; or underwent submarine training in active naval service before January 1, 1965. Veterans with exposure to NP radium treatments are eligible to receive treatment for conditions related head and neck cancer\n  \n  \n    If the veteran is being treated for any condition during this episode of care\n    that is for Head and Neck Cancer; the visit should be checked as related on the encounter form and the medication should be designated for Head and Neck Cancer. This will mean that the veteran does not have to pay a copayment for the visit or the medication.\n  \n   \n  \n    Camp Lejeune\n  \n  \n    From the 1950s to the 1980s, people living or working at the U.S. Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune (CL), NC, were exposed to drinking water contaminated with industrial solvents, benzene, and other chemicals. Veterans and family members who served on active duty or resided at Camp Lejeune for 30 days or more between Aug. 1, 1953 and Dec. 31, 1987 may be eligible for VA health benefits for 15 conditions:\n  \n  \n    Esophageal cancer\n    Breast cancer\n    Kidney cancer\n    Multiple myeloma\n    Renal toxicity\n    Female infertility\n    Scleroderma\n    Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma\n    Lung cancer\n    Bladder cancer\n    Leukemia\n    Myelodysplastic syndromes\n    Hepatic steatosis\n    Miscarriage\n    Neurobehavioral effects\n  \n  On August 6, 2012, President Obama signed into law the “Honoring America’s Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012” (P. L. 112-154). This law provides health care for Veterans who served on active duty at Camp Lejeune and reimbursement for health care to family members who resided at Camp Lejeune for not fewer than 30 days between August 1, 1953 and December 31, 1987. The law authorizes care for 15 medical conditions, even if there is insufficient medical evidence to conclude that such illnesses or conditions are attributable to the Veterans’ military service or family members’ residence at Camp Lejeune.\n  \n      Note:\n            The Camp Lejeune environmental indicator will not be available until the release of patch OR*3.0*407.\n    \n   \n   \n  \n

Using this view, a clinician can record decisions for all orders assigned to a patient to ensure that the correct medication orders are continued for the patient upon discharge. \n  \n    Previously, when preparations were made to discharge a patient, the clinician had to switch views from inpatient to outpatient medication forms. The UAP enables the clinician to review all medication orders at one time. This view simplifies order reconciliation and reduces the time and effort required from the clinician when making decisions on each active inpatient and outpatient order. \n   \n  Understanding UAP Sorting\n  The UAP view sorts medication orders by medication name, with inpatient orders, outpatient orders, and non-VA medication (Documentation) entries grouped together. This grouping is essential for medication reconciliation when preparing a patient for discharge. UAP sorting is based on the name of the first orderable item from the Orderable Items file (#101.43). However, subsequent changes to the order can disrupt this rule and alter the way that the order is sorted by UAP. \n   \n  The Order Text field (#100.0081) in the Order file (#100) is a word processing field that is generated when an order is created. Additional Order Text fields are added each time the order is modified. When working with an order in CPRS, the content of the most recent Order Text field is displayed. UAP checks the first line of the Order Text field against the orderable item name. If this check detects that the first line of the Order Text field does not match the orderable item name, then the order is sorted based on the first line of the most recent Order Text field. \n   \n  For example, a clinician places an order for “DIAPER TABBED MISCELLANEOUS BRIEF, TRANQUILITY SMARTCORE SMALL #2311.” \n  \n    This item is retrieved from the Orderable Items file and saved in the Order Text field when the order is placed. During processing, the Pharmacist changes the order to “BRIEF, TRANQUILITY SMARTCORE SMALL #2311” and this update is saved as a new entry in the Order Text field. During sorting, UAP performs a check and detects that the Orderable Item name and the first line of the most recent entry in the Order Text field are not the same and sorts the item based on the Order Text field entry (i.e., “BRIEF, TRANQUILITY SMARTCORE SMALL #2311”). If an order is modified by a pharmacist during prescription processing, then the order is marked with an asterisk (“*”) when displayed in CPRS. In the UAP view, this asterisk is hidden when displaying orders to preserve the alphabetical sorting critical to the reconciliation process. \n   \n  Infusions are sorted alphabetically by the first orderable item identified as an additive in the Orderable Items file; solutions are ignored for the purpose of sorting. The display of Infusion orderable items is reorganized based on the additive used for sorting. This supports alphabetical sorting by a meaningful additive in the UAP but does not change the original order of items in the ORDER file (#100). \n   \n  Configuring UAP \n  Before UAP can work as designed, some setup is required. First, Write Delayed Orders must be configured for the DISCHARGE event.\n  Note:      To perform the following actions, the DISCHARGE event must be active and Copy Active Orders for Discharge Release Events must be disabled.\n   \n  Refer to the CPRS Technical Manual: GUI Version for details.\n   \n  To configure the Write Delayed Orders feature for the Discharge event:\n  1.    From the CPRS Orders tab, select Write Delayed Orders. The Release Orders window displays. \n    2.    Select the Delay release of new order(s) until radio button. \n    3.    Select DISCHARGE from the Event Delay List. \n    4.    Adjust the Effective Date if necessary and then select OK.\n  \n  This shows how to get the delayed order ready that you will be using.\n   \n  Note: If the provider has an NPI, it will not display on the screen above.\n  \n    The view changes to the Delayed DISCHARGE Orders view. The Discharge Patient (Delayed DISCHARGE) dialog box displays with DISCHARGE as the selected event.  \n   \n  5.    Select a Discharge Type (e.g., REGULAR) and then click Accept Order. \n  \n    The Delayed Discharge order displays on the Orders tab. The Service column displays the service “A/D/T” after the order is configured. The Delayed Discharge order remains unsigned until after the UAP review decisions are completed and all medication orders for the patient are ready to be signed. \n  Note:   To perform the following actions, the UAP view must be turned On by a CAC or OI&T staff member. If UAP is not displayed in the View menu, then the feature is turned Off. Refer to the CPRS Technical Manual: GUI Version for details. \n   \n  Reconciling Medications Previous to Patient Discharge\n  Note: The previous steps must be completed before this reconciliation section.\n   \n  To use the UAP view to reconcile all inpatient and outpatient medications when preparing a patient for discharge:\n  1.    Select Unified Action Profile (UAP) from the View menu.  \n  \n  The Orders tab View menu with the Unified Action Profile (UAP) outlined in red.\n   \n  The Unified Action Profile view is displayed and ready for you to take action on each inpatient and outpatient medication. \n   \n  Example: Infusion Orders – ALL SERVICES view vs. UAP view  \n  Remember that UAP changes the sort order of medications.\n   \n  All Services: The following Infusion order is displayed in the ALL SERVICES view. The asterisk indicates that the order was changed by the pharmacist.\n  \n  Standard view with Infusion order asterisk in front of the order\n   \n  UAP View: In the UAP view, the Infusion order components are intentionally reorganized for sorting purposes to facilitate medication reconciliation. The asterisk is hidden; the first orderable additive item in the ORDER file, INSULIN, is listed first and the Infusion is displayed in the medication list accordingly. The solution (DEXTROSE) is ignored for sorting purposes.\n  \n  UAP sort, removed asterisk and using first order additive.\n   \n  2.    Right-click on a medication order and then select an available reconciliation action from the popup list. \n  The UAP view on the orders tab. Above the service column, text showing that UAP is being viewed, a context menu shows actions that can be taken, and the Reviewed column shows actions taken.\n   \n  Note:    Infusion orders cannot be continued, changed, or renewed using UAP because CPRS does not convert inpatient infusion orders to an outpatient order when preparing for discharge. To prevent issues with discharge medication orders, these options are grayed when performing UAP medication reconciliation for an inpatient Infusion order.  \n  3.    Complete required information in the secondary window that displays when a reconciliation action is selected. Not all selected actions will display a secondary window. \n  Selecting certain actions, such as Change, will open the Copy Orders window. When this window displays, the Delay release of copied orders radio button is selected by default. Select DISCHARGE from the list of suggested events, and then select OK. \n   \n  \n  The copy orders dialog\n   \n  Copy Orders Window\n  When DISCHARGE is selected, the view automatically reverts to Delayed Discharge Orders. Additional secondary windows, such as Outpatient Medications, open for configuring the Delayed Discharge medication order.  \n    The decision made for each inpatient and outpatient medication is displayed in the UAP “Reviewed” column. Information regarding whether an order was reviewed using the UAP, and who last reviewed it, is added to the order record in the Orders file (#100) in VistA.\n   Note:   When a reconciliation action is canceled before it is complete (for example, if you click Cancel in the Copy Orders window), then no decision is recorded for the selected medication. The action is briefly displayed in the UAP “Reviewed” column, but after processing the display toggles back to the UAP view, the UAP “Reviewed” column is cleared, and no decision is recorded in VistA. \n  \n  The Reviewed column show what actions were taken on the order.\n   \n   Note: If the provider has an NPI, it will not display on the screen above.\n  After completing the UAP review, use the Discharge Meds view to see a complete list of outpatient medications prescribed for the patient at the time of discharge (refer to Using the Discharge Meds View). \n   \n  Using the Discharge Meds View\n  The Discharge Meds view on the Orders tab displays a list of the remaining active outpatient orders after medication decisions are recorded in the Unified Action Profile (UAP) view (refer to Using the Unified Action Profile View.). It displays the orders that will be released with the patient upon discharge. While the UAP provides the ability to review and make decisions about all inpatient and outpatient medications, the Discharge Meds view enables a clinician to see the full list of medication orders from the local site still prescribed for the patient after the UAP review is completed. \n   \n  To use the Discharge Meds view of all prescribed medications for a patient being discharged: \n  1.    Select Discharge Meds from the View menu on the Orders tab. \n   \n  2.    Review the information for each medication displayed on the Discharge Meds Review pane. Verify the dosage, quantity, Start/Stop date, and Status for each outpatient medication prescribed for the patient being discharged.\n   \n  \n    Related Topics\n  \n  \n    Viewing Orders \n  \n

In the CPRS GUI, there are three places where users can see if a patient has PRF:\n·      The Patient Record Flag Pop-up Box\n·      The CPRS Cover Sheet\n·      The Flag button (available from any tab)\n \nWhen the user selects a patient name from the Patient Selection Screen, CPRS begins to load the record, displays any relevant messages (\"means test require\", deceased patient, sensitive record, etc.), and then, if the record is flagged, displays a pop-up box with the flag titles for the selected patient to ensure that the user sees the flags. The pop-up box is shown below.\nThe Patient Record Flags pop-up box displays a list of all flags for the patient, with the first flag in the list highlighted and the narrative for that flag displayed below the flag list and a list of links to notes that have been linked to flag actions. Category I flags are displayed first, followed by any Category II (or local) flags.\nThe flag narrative is the text the person assigning the flag enters that they want the user to see. It should give the purpose of the flag and may also contain examples of past behavior and instructions for users to follow when encountering the patient. For example, the narrative for a particular Behavioral flag might state that a patient has been known to carry weapons and has verbally threatened VHA staff in the past. It may also recommend that users call the VA police if this patient comes in for care. However, the purpose of Patient Record Flags is not to stigmatize nor discriminate, rather it is protect VHA staff and patients and to ensure the efficient delivery of health care.\nOn the bottom of the Patient Record Flags popup box, CPRS displays a list of notes that are linked to specific flag actions. Links will only display for those notes that have been signed and linked to a flag action. When the user selects a link, CPRS displays the linked progress note for the action in a detailed display window.\nUsers can review the flags or close the box.\nWhen the user is already in a patient record and wants to view Patient Record Flags, the user can use either the listing on the Cover Sheet or the Flag button. On the CPRS Cover Sheet, a new box called Patient Record Flags has been added above the Postings area. Flags for the selected patient are listed in the box.\nThe Flag button is visible from all CPRS tabs. If a patient's record has been flagged, the Flag button with its red text displays next to the Remote Data button. If the patient's record does not have any flags, the text on the button is grayed out instead of red. The Cover Sheet and Flag button are shown in the graphic below.\n \n\nThis screen capture shows the red text on the Flag button indicating this patient record has PRF and shows the flag list on the CPRS Cover Sheet.\n \nTo view a Patient Record Flag when entering a record, use the following steps:\n1.     Select a patient from the Patient Selection screen by either double-clicking on a patient name or highlighting the name and pressing the <Enter> key.\nNote:      When the record loads, CPRS checks to see if the record is sensitive and displays a warning to the user that the user must acknowledge to proceed. Then, if the record has one or more flags, CPRS displays a pop-up box with the patient's record flags title. The first flag is highlighted and the narrative details displayed below. If CPRS displays the pop-up box, the user must close this box before CPRS will load the patient chart.\n \n2.     Then, bring up the flag narrative you want to view by selecting the flag name or highlighting the flag name with the tab and arrow keys and pressing <Tab> (note that the number of flags in each category is listed after the category label).\n \n\nThis graphic shows the Patient Record Flag pop-up box listing the patient's flags, the narrative for the highlighted flag, and the links to any signed, linked progress notes documenting the reasons for the flag. Using the Flag button or clicking on a flag title on the Cover Sheet also displays this pop-up box. Category I flags are in the orange field, they blink, and the text changes color from white to black and back.

Although OE/RR encompassed more than just order entry and results reporting (including Progress Notes, Consults/Request Tracking, notifications, and so on), CPRS is more comprehensive in its components, capabilities, open architecture, and general design.\nCPRS is the umbrella package for clinical software. You can access CPRS through either this graphical user interface (GUI)--Windows--or through the terminal-based user interface (List Manager). CPRS includes ordering, Consults, Progress Notes, Problem List, Imaging (X-rays and other procedures), Lab results, Discharge Summary, Reports, and other clinically relevant information and processes.\nIn short, CPRS supports the new directions of VISTA:\n·      An increased focus on ambulatory care\n·      Improved patient service through readier and more complete access to patient records\n·      The ability to share and transfer data among disciplines and between facilities\n·      The ability to track a patient's history and treatment over time\n·      The ability to track

required patient-specific,procedure-specific, and specimen-specific information to facilitate specimen processing by pathologists.  A new Anatomic Pathology Order Dialog is available with the following available order types:\n  \n    \n      Bone Marrow\n    \n    \n      Bronchial Biopsy\n    \n    \n      Bronchial Cytology\n    \n    \n      Dermatology\n    \n    \n      Fine Needle

available order types, such as seen below, for example Bone Marrow, Bronchial Biopsy, etc. \n  \n    Because each order type may require different information, different order dialog fields display

On this dialog, the user selects the type, such as Dermatology. Red boxes and numbers added to describe different areas.\n   \n  \n    \n  \n   \n  The dialog has several areas that interact. Some areas of the dialog are described briefly below.\n  \n    Order-specific fields such as Urgency and Collection Date/Time.\n    List of Specimens for this order.\n    The Current Specimen being viewed in box 4.\n    Specimen-specific fields, such as the Specimen Description//Anatomic Site.\n    Button to delete the current specimen.\n    Multiple tabs to enter free text fields, such as Clinical History.\n  \n   \n  When the user selects Anatomic Pathology from an order menu or the Orders pane, the Anatomic Pathology Ordering dialog displays and the first thing to select is an order type (e.g., Bone Marrow, Dermatology, etc).\n   \n  When an order type is selected, the rest of the fields on the dialog change to gather the information for that type of order. \n   \n  To place an Anatomic Pathology order, use these steps:\n  \n  \n    Select Anatomic Pathology from the Orders menu.\n    In the Anatomic Pathology Ordering dialog, under Available Orders, select the type of order (e.g., Bone Marrow, Dermatology, etc.).\n    Fill out the order specific information, such as Urgency, Collection Date/Time, Collection Type, etc.\n    On the right of the dialog, select a specimen from the drop down list and provide a specimen description. There must be at least one specimen and a specimen description to accept the order. As you select a specimen and description, a list of specimens is created. To view each specimen, highlight the specimen from the list and the description will display. \n    The fields may change when you select a type. Fill out the necessary fields.\n    For some order types, the user can enter some free text under Clinical History on such tabs as Pre-Operative Diagnosis, Operative Findings, and Post-Operative Findings.\n    At the bottom of the dialog, the order text created when the user filled in the fields is displayed.\n  \n   \n  Related Topics\n  \n    \n      Viewing Laboratory Test Results\n    \n

If turned off, the required fields will continue to display with an asterisk, but the features identified above will not. These features are not currently available for Reminders.\n   \n  How It Works\n  A navigation bar assists with finding and completing “required” fields.  This navigation bar will allow the user to quickly access all required fields in the template dialog.  The navigation bar provides a count of all unanswered required fields and provides navigation buttons to allow the user to jump directly to the required field.  In addition to the * used to identify required fields, all incomplete required fields will be highlighted within the template. \n  Once the required field is filled in, the counter will reduce and the highlight for the field will be removed.\n   \n  \n    This screen capture illustrates how required fields are highlighted. The highlight color can be customized.\n  \n   \n  Customizing the Navigation Bar position and the Highlight Color\n  Navigation bar position: The position of the required fields navigation bar can be changed to the Top, Left, Right, and Bottom of the template dialog. This can be accomplished by accessing the Right Click (Context) menu associated with the Navigation Bar. By right clicking on the navigation bar, the user is presented with the choice of Top, Left, Right, and Bottom. After selecting the position you want, the navigation bar will immediately move to the selected position. \n   \n  Enable or Disable Required Fields Display\n  The user also has the ability to enable/disable the highlighting within the template. By accessing the Right Click (Context) menu associated with the body of the template, the user will see an option to Highlight Required Fields without Value.  When checked highlighting is enabled while when it is unchecked the highlighting is disabled. \n   \n  You may also adjust all of the template required fields settings by using the Set Highlighting Preferences option. \n  To access, the user can\n  \n    \n      Right Click (Context) within the body of the template and select Set Highlighting Preferences. \n    \n    \n      Or users can select Tools | Options… | Notes tab and then select the Required Fields button.\n    \n  \n   \n  \n    Dialog to select whether fields display, the highlight color, and the navigation bar position.\n  \n   \n  Then the user can select the highlight color using the drop-down box.\n   \n  The user also select

from the\n    Cover Sheet\n    tab in either of two ways:\n  \n  \n    ·     Right-click anywhere within the\n    Allergies/Adverse Reactions\n    pane.\n  \n  \n    ·     Click to display more information about a causative agent listed in the\n    Allergies/Adverse Reactions\n    pane.\n  \n  \n    Method One\n  \n  \n    Take the following steps to enter new allergies using the first of the two methods mentioned above:\n  \n  1.   Move your mouse arrow to a location anywhere within the Allergies/Adverse Reactions\n    pane.\n  \n  2.   Right-click to display a pop-up menu.\n  \n    3.   From this menu, select\n    Enter new allergy\n    . CPRS displays the\n    Allergy Reactant Lookup\n    dialog.\n  \n  \n    4.   In the\n    Enter causative agent for Allergy or Adverse Drug Reaction\n    field, type the first few characters (minimum of three) of the causative agent's name.\n  \n  \n    5.   Select\n    Search.\n    CPRS displays a list of possible matches.\n  \n  \n    6.    If you click on any drug ingredient listed in the Drug Ingredients File drop-down, you will get a notification that Drug Class cross checking will not occur.  However, if you check the checkbox next to the notification, you will be able to enter the drug ingredient, as shown below (the notification is highlighted in red for emphasis):\n    \n  \n  \n    7.   If the causative agent you typed does not match any of the agents currently available for your site, CPRS displays the Causative Agent Not On File\n    dialog, from which you can select one of the following three options:\n  \n  \n    Note:     \n     The patient's chart will not be updated unless you choose a causative agent that is on file.\n  \n   \n  \n    a)    Yes\n    : Use this option to request that the causative agent be added for your site's ALLERGIES file. When you click\n    Yes\n    , CPRS displays the\n    Enter Optional Comments\n    dialog, which enables you to type additional comments (optional), such as the signs or symptoms that occurred as a result of contact with this causative agent, or whether you observed these symptoms firsthand. After you type your comments, click\n    Continue\n    .\n    CPRS then\n    sends to members of your site's GMRA Request New Reactant mail group a message that includes the following items:\n  \n  \n    ·      The causative agent you attempted to enter\n  \n  ·      The name of the patient for whom you attempted to make this entry\n  ·      Your name, title, and contact information\n  ·      Your comments\n   \n  \n    Note:      When the bulletin is sent, a message such as the following will display. This message also informs the user that the allergy was NOT entered into the patient's record.\n  \n   \n  \n    Members of your site's GMRA Request New Reactant mail group\n    will review this message and, if appropriate, add the causative agent to your site's ALLERGIES file.\n  \n   \n  \n    Note:\n         \n     \n    If your site's IRM staff has not yet added members to your site's GMRA Request New Reactant mail group, CPRS displays the following message: Mail\n    group GMRA Request New Reactant has no members - Contact IRM..\n  \n   \n  \n    b)    No\n    : Clicking\n    No\n    enables you to try an alternate spelling or trade name for your causative agent, or to type another causative agent.\n  \n  \n    c)    Cancel\n    : Use this option if you want to cancel your allergy order.\n  \n   \n  \n    8.    If the causative agent you typed matches an agent that is currently available for your site, select the agent. (Click\n    +\n    to expand a heading.)\n  \n  \n    Note: \n         With CPRS GUI 24 or later, you may not add free-text causative agents. If you select an item under the \"Add new free-text allergy\" heading, CPRS displays the \n      Causative Agent Not On File\n    \n    dialog.\n  \n   \n  \n    9.    Select\n    OK\n    .\n  \n  \n    The Enter Allergy or Adverse Reaction dialog appears.\n  \n  \n    Note\n    :      You can view a patient's current allergies or adverse reactions by selecting the\n    Active Allergies\n    button. Also, the user previously could change the Originator, but this is no longer allowed. The originator is the user logged in.\n  \n   \n  \n    10.  Use the\n    Observed\n    or\n    Historical\n    option button to indicate whether the entry is for an observed or historical allergy, respectively. (If you point your mouse at either of these option buttons, CPRS displays a hover hint that explains the observed and historical options.)\n  \n  \n    Note:\n         Observed or Historical used to have a default, but the user must now select the appropriate choice. CPRS does not allow you to select future dates for observed allergy/adverse reaction entries.\n  \n   \n  \n    Note:      When you select Observed for a drug reaction, CPRS generates a Progress Note. Once this note is signed by the user entering the allergy or by an administrative update user, the note will be viewable by all users.\n  \n   \n  \n    11.   Select the Nature of Reaction (Allergy, Pharmacological, or Unknown).\n  \n  \n    Th\n    e Nature of Reaction can be Allergy, Pharmacologic, or Unknown. An allergic reaction occurs because the patient is sensitive to a causative agent, regardless of the amount the patient is exposed to. A pharmacologic (non-allergic) reaction occurs when the patient is sensitive to an agent under certain conditions, such as exposure to a large amount. Unknown is provided if you are not sure what Nature of Reaction (mechanism) to enter.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n          Allergies are a subset of adverse reactions. All allergies are adverse reactions, but not all adverse reactions are allergies.\n  \n   \n  \n    12.   If you are entering an observed allergy, use the\n    Reaction Date/Time\n    and\n    Severity\n    boxes to select a reaction date, time, and severity. (The\n    Severity\n    box is not visible for historical allergies.\n    If the\n    Severity\n    box is visible, CPRS displays a\n    ?\n    button at its side. If you select this button, CPRS displays text explaining severity selections.)\n  \n  \n    13.   Using the\n    Signs/Symptoms\n    box, select one or more signs or symptoms. The signs and symptoms you select appear in the\n    Selected Symptoms\n    pane.\n  \n  \n    Note:      You must enter at least one Sign/Symptom and enter a comment of at least four characters when documenting a historical allergy/adverse drug reason. Signs and symptoms must be selected from the list. Users cannot enter free-text entries.\n  \n   \n  \n    14.  To associate a date and time with a symptom (optional), click to select the symptom in the\n    Selected Symptoms\n    pane.\n  \n  \n    15.  Select the\n    Date/Time\n    button located below the\n    Selected Symptoms\n    pane. CPRS displays the\n    Select Date/Time\n    dialog, from which you can select the date and time that the symptom first appeared.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n          If you mistakenly enter a sign or symptom but have not yet\n    accepted it by selecting OK, select the symptom in the\n    Selected Symptoms\n    pane and select the\n    Remove\n    button located beneath the pane.\n  \n   \n  \n    16.   Type comments for the allergy in the\n    Comments\n    text box.\n  \n  \n    17.   If you have marked the allergy or adverse reaction on the\n    patient's identification (ID) band (or if you know that someone else has), select the\n    ID Band Marked\n    check box.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n         CPRS activates the\n    ID Band Marked\n    check box only for inpatients and then only if your site's IRM staff has set a parameter indicating that your site wants to track this information. Depending on whether your IRM staff has set related parameters, if you do\n    not\n    select activated\n    ID Band Marked\n    check box, the system may send a bulletin notifying a mail group that the patient's\n    allergy or adverse reaction is not marked on his or her ID band.\n  \n  \n    18.   Select\n    OK\n    .\n  \n  \n    Note:     When you click OK, CPRS generates an email bulletin to the GMRA MARK CHART mail group. The bulletin provides a reminder that the patient chart must be updated with the allergy/adverse reaction information displayed in the bulletin message. \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        19.  If the newly entered allergy is related to existing pending and active orders, then the Existing Medication Allergy dialog is displayed for each order discovered.\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        20.  An Existing Medication Allergy will result in the NEW ALLERGY ENTERED/ACTIVE MED notification being sent to the default providers defined in the ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS parameter. Those providers who are able to receive the notification are displayed. Note, if a default provider recipient is unable to receive the notification they will not be listed. \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        21.  The person entering the new allergy will also be able to select Optional Recipients to receive the NEW ALLERGY ENTERED/ACTIVE MED notification. \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    CPRS displays the newly entered causative agent in the\n    Allergies/Adverse Reactions\n    pane. If you click on the causative agent, CPRS displays all of the information you just entered about the associated allergy or adverse reaction. CPRS also displays the letter\n    A\n    (for allergies) on the\n    Postings\n    button and the word\n    Allergies\n    in the\n    Postings\n    pane. If you click the word\n    Allergies\n    in the\n    Postings\n    pane, CPRS displays selected information about all of the patient's active allergies and adverse reactions, including the allergy or adverse reaction you just entered.\n  \n   \n  \n    Method Two\n  \n  \n    Take the following steps to enter a new allergy using the second of the two methods mentioned above:\n  \n  \n    1.     Select a causative agent listed in the\n    Allergies/Adverse Reactions\n    pane. CPRS displays a dialog that includes details about the allergy or adverse reaction associated with the selected causative agent. The dialog also includes four buttons.\n  \n  \n    2.     Select the\n    Add New\n    button.\n  \n  \n    CPRS displays the\n    Allergy Reactant Lookup\n    dialog.\n  \n   \n  \n    3.     Follow steps 4 through 17 of the instructions for entering allergies using the first method. CPRS displays the newly entered causative agent in the\n    Allergies/Adverse Reactions\n    pane. If you click on the causative agent, CPRS displays all of the information you just entered about the associated allergy or adverse reaction. CPRS also displays the letter\n    A\n    (for allergies) on the\n    Postings\n    button and the word\n    Allergies\n    in the\n    Postings\n    pane. If you click the word\n    Allergies\n    in the\n    Postings\n    pane, CPRS displays selected information about all of the patient's allergies or adverse reactions, including the allergy or adverse reaction you just entered.\n  \n   \n  \n    Related topics\n  \n  Causative Agent Not On File\n  Entering Allergies from the Orders Tab\n  Marking Allergies as Entered in Error\n  Viewing Allergies/Adverse Reactions\n  Viewing Postings\n\n","Path::contents/Entering_Allergies_from_the_Cover_Sheet_Tab.htm::mtimeMs":1619816830488.4336,"Path::contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Viewing_a_Health_Summary.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Viewing_a_Health_Summary.htm"},{"origLink":"Viewing_a_Report.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Viewing_a_Report.htm"}],"Path::contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm::Title":"Available Reports on the Reports Tab","Path::contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Available reports,Date,Date:range,Department of Defense,DoD,FHIE,GCPR,Read-only,Reports,Reports:Reports-only: CPRS Read Only,Reports:available in CPRS,Health:Factors","Path::contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Available Reports on the Reports Tab\n  \n  \n    The table below lists the reports available from the Reports tab\n    .

Tab","Path::contents/Entering_Allergies_from_the_Orders_Tab.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Entering Allergies from the Orders Tab\n  \n  \n    Although allergies and adverse reactions are not orders and CPRS does not display them on the\n    Orders\n    tab, you can enter allergies and adverse reactions from the\n    Orders\n    tab. You can also enter allergies from the\n    Cover Sheet\n    tab. (See \n      Entering Allergies from the Cover Sheet\n    \n    .)\n  \n  \n    To enter allergies or adverse\n    reactions from the Orders tab, take the following steps:\n  \n  \n    1.    Select the\n    Orders\n    tab.\n  \n  \n    2.    Select\n    Allergies\n    from the\n    Write Orders\n    pane.\n  \n  \n    The Allergy Reactant Lookup dialog appears.\n  \n  Note: Your site may have defined and configured other order menus to include allergy-entry dialogs. Regardless of the allergy-entry menu you select, if you haven’t entered encounter information, the Location for Current Activities dialog appears before the Allergy Reactant Lookup dialog appears. You must complete the Location for Current Activities dialog before proceeding.\n  \n    3.    Type the causative agent in the search field. (You must enter the first three letters (minimum) of the agent's name.)\n  \n  \n    4.     Select\n    Search.\n  \n  \n    Matching agents appear in the\n    Select from one of the following items\n    pane. If the causative agent you typed does not match any of the agents currently available for your site, CPRS displays the \n      Causative Agent Not On File\n    \n    dialog, from which you can select one of the following options:\n  \n  \n    Note:      The patient's chart will not be updated unless you choose a causative agent that is on file.\n  \n  \n    5.    If you click on any drug ingredient listed in the Drug Ingredients File drop-down, you will get a notification that Drug Class cross checking will not occur. However, if you check the checkbox next to the notification, you will be able to enter the drug ingredient, as shown below (the notification is highlighted in red for emphasis): \n  \n  \n  \n    a)    Yes\n    : Use this option to request that the causative agent be added for your site. When you click\n    Yes,\n     CPRS displays the\n    Enter Optional Comments\n    dialog, which enables you to type additional comments (optional), such as the signs or symptoms that occurred as a result of contact with this causative agent, or whether you observed these symptoms firsthand. After you type your comments, click\n    Continue.\n    CPRS then\n    sends\n    to members of your site's GMRA Request New Reactant mail group a message that includes the following items:\n  \n  ·      The causative agent you attempted to enter\n  ·      The name of the patient for whom you attempted to make this entry\n  ·      Your name, title, and contact information\n  ·      Your comments\n   \n  \n    Note:      When the bulletin is sent, a message such as the following will display. This message also informs the user that the allergy was NOT entered into the patient\"s record.\n  \n   \n  \n    \"Members of your site's GMRA Request New Reactant mail group will review this message and, if appropriate, add the causative agent to your site's ALLERGIES file.\"\n  \n  \n    Note:\n         \n    If your site's IRM staff has not yet added members to your site's GMRA Request New Reactant mail group, CPRS\n    displays the following message: Mail group GMRA Request New Reactant has no members - Contact IRM.\n  \n   \n  \n    b)    No\n    : Use this option if you want to try an alternate spelling or trade name for your causative agent, or if you want to type another causative agent.\n  \n  \n    c)    Cancel\n    : Use this option if you want to cancel your allergy order.\n  \n   \n  \n    6.     If the causative agent you typed matches an agent that is currently available for your site, select the agent. (Click\n    +\n    to expand a heading.)\n  \n  \n    Note: \n         With CPRS GUI 24 or later, you may not add free-text causative agents. If you select an item under the \"Add new free-text allergy\" heading, CPRS displays the \n      Causative Agent Not On File\n    \n    dialog.\n  \n   \n  \n    7.     Select\n    OK\n    .\n  \n  \n    The Enter Allergy or Adverse Reaction dialog appears.\n  \n  \n    Note\n    :      You can view a patient's current allergies or adverse reactions by clicking the\n    Active Allergies\n    button. Also, CPRS no longer allows the user to change the allergy Originator.\n  \n   \n  \n    8.    Use the\n    Observed\n    or\n    Historical\n    option button to indicate whether the entry is for an observed or historical allergy, respectively. (When you point your mouse at either of these buttons, CPRS displays a hover hint explaining the observed and historical options.)\n  \n  \n    Note: \n         Observed or Historical used to have a default,\n    but the user must now select the appropriate choice. CPRS does not allow you to select future dates for observed allergy/adverse reaction entries.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n          When you select Observed for a drug reaction, CPRS generates a Progress Note. Once this note is signed\n    by the user entering the allergy or by an administrative update user, the note will be viewable by all users.\n  \n   \n  \n    9.    Select the Nature of Reaction (Allergy, Pharmacological, or Unknown).\n  \n  \n    The Nature of Reaction (also known as mechanism) can be Allergy, Pharmacologic, or Unknown. An allergic reaction occurs because the patient is sensitive to a causative agent, regardless of the amount the patient is exposed to. A pharmacologic (non-allergic) reaction occurs when the patient is sensitive to an agent under certain conditions, such as exposure to a large amount. Unknown is provided if you are not sure what mechanism to enter.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n          Allergies are a subset of the world of adverse reactions. All allergies are adverse reactions, but not all adverse reactions are allergies.\n  \n   \n  \n    10.  If you are entering an observed allergy, use the\n    Reaction Date/Time\n    and\n    Severity\n    boxes to select a reaction date, time, and severity. (The\n    Severity\n    box is not visible for historical allergies. When the Severity box is visible, CPRS displays a\n    ?\n    button next to it. If you click this button, CPRS displays text that provides information about available severity selections.)\n  \n  \n    Note:      CPRS does not allow you to enter future dates for observed reactions.\n  \n   \n  \n    11.  Using the\n    Signs/Symptoms\n    box, select one or more signs or symptoms. The signs and symptoms you select appear in the\n    Selected Symptoms\n    pane.\n  \n  \n    12.  To associate a date and time with a symptom (optional), click to select the symptom in the\n    Selected Symptoms\n    pane.\n  \n  \n    13.  Select the\n    Date/Time\n    button located below the\n    Selected Symptoms\n    pane.\n  \n  \n    CPRS displays the\n    Select Date/Time\n    dialog, from which you can select the date and time that the symptom first appeared.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n          If you mistakenly enter a sign or symptom but have not yet accepted it by selecting OK, select the symptom in the\n    Selected Symptoms\n    pane and click the\n    Remove\n    button located beneath the pane.\n  \n   \n  \n    14.  Type comments for the allergy in the\n    Comments\n    box.\n  \n  \n    15.  If you have marked the allergy or adverse reaction on the patient's identification (ID) band (or if you know someone else has), select the\n    ID Band Marked\n    check box.\n  \n  \n    Note:\n          CPRS activates the\n    ID Band Marked\n    check box only for inpatients and then only if your site's IRM staff has set a parameter indicating that your site\n    wants to track this information. Depending on whether your IRM staff has set related parameters, if you do\n    not\n    select activated\n    ID Band Marked\n    check box, the system may send a bulletin notifying a mail group that the patient's allergy or adverse reaction\n    is not marked on his or her ID band.\n  \n   \n  \n    16.   Select\n    OK.\n  \n  \n    Note:     When you click OK, CPRS generates an email bulletin to the GMRA MARK CHART mail group. The bulletin provides a reminder that the patient chart must be updated with the allergy/adverse reaction information displayed in the bulletin message.\n  \n   \n  \n    17.  If the newly entered allergy is related to existing pending and active orders, then the Existing Medication Allergy dialog is displayed for each order discovered.\n  \n  \n    18.  An Existing Medication Allergy will result in the NEW ALLERGY ENTERED/ACTIVE MED notification being sent to the default providers defined in the ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS parameter. Those providers who are able to receive the notification are displayed. Note, if a default provider recipient is unable to receive the notification they will not be listed.\n  \n  \n    19. The person entering the new allergy will also be able to select Optional Recipients to receive the NEW ALLERGY ENTERED/ACTIVE MED notification.\n  \n  \n    Note:     Although CPRS does not display allergy-related assessments on the Orders tab, you can also enter an assessment of no known allergies (NKA) from the Orders tab.\n  \n   \n  \n    Related topics\n  \n  Entering Allergies from the Cover Sheet Tab\n  Causative Agent Not on File\n  Marking Allergies as Entered in Error\n  Viewing Allergies/Adverse Reactions\n\n","Path::contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm::mtimeMs":1619933655259.462,"Path::contents/Entering_Allergies_from_the_Orders_Tab.htm::mtimeMs":1619927915852.446}
