The Problems tab now uses Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine—Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) for documenting problems on the patient’s problem list.\n  Note:      Remember that the diagnosis on the Encounter form can be added to the Problems tab by simply selecting the checkbox to put it there.\n   \n  With the Lexicon search, the initial search contains frequently used problems within the VA and new problems are added each Lexicon Quarterly release. The Extended Search represents a larger subset of SNOMED CT containing all the terms from the Clinical Findings, Events, and Situation with Explicit Context hierarchies. Currently, all terms are linked to a placeholder ICD-10-CM code of R69 and may be updated through the Encounter Form workflow.\n  To speed up documentation in Problem List and to avoid the dual entry in the Encounter Form application, enhancements were completed to enable the use of the VA-National Problem Selection List or a VISN, or local problem selection list. Sites can use the National Problem Selection List that has curated Problem Categories with problems represented in SNOMED CT that are linked to ICD-10-CM code(s). In addition, sites can create Local Problem Selection Lists. Users or clinics who want to create their own Local Problem Selection List will need to request this from a Clinical Application Coordinator (CAC) and will be responsible for maintaining these Local lists. \n  It is highly recommended that sites use the National Problem Selection List because it will be nationally maintained.  The National Problem Selection List will display by default unless the user or clinic already has a Problem Selection List defined. The Problem Selection List is displayed in the left pane of the Add a New Problem dialog.\n   \n  To add a new problem to a patient’s problem list, use these steps:\n  \n    1.     Select the\n    Problems\n    tab.\n  \n  \n    2.     Select\n    New Problem\n  \n  \n    -or-\n  \n  \n    select\n    Action\n    |\n    New Problem...\n    .\n  \n  \n    The Problem List Lexicon Search dialog displays.\n  \n  \n    Note:    \n    If encounter information has not been entered, the encounter information dialog will appear before the Problem List Lexicon Search dialog. You must enter an encounter location and provider before proceeding.\n  \n  \n  If sites have not assigned a different problem selection list to a user or clinic, the VA-National Problem List Selection list will display as shown above. The top pane shows the problem categories. Selecting a category will display the problems in that category in the pane below.\n   \n  \n    3.    If the user is set up to use the National Problem Selection List the National Problem Categories with the associated problem are displayed based on the category. If the problem is not found within the category, skip to step 4 by selecting Other Problem to bring up the Problem List Lexicon Search dialog.\n  \n  \n  \n    The Problem List Lexicon Search dialog enables users to search for the term that best describes the patient’s problem. SNOMED codes are used to define the problems..\n  \n   \n  \n    4.      Enter part or all of a term that describes the problem in the Enter Term to Search field and press\n    <Enter>\n    or select\n    Search\n    .\n  \n  CPRS will search the lexicon for problems that contain the search term. The matching problems will appear in the bottom portion of the Problem List Lexicon Search dialog. The search now looks for SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). There is also a parameter to hide the codes if sites so choose.\n  \n  In this search, some items have additional items grouped under them. The user can expand items with an arrow next to them to see additional items.\n  5.     Select the appropriate term if it is in the list. If you do not see the appropriate problem listed, select the Extend Search button.\n  \n    On the Problems tab, the Extend Search button extends the search to a larger subset of SNOMED CT.\n  \n  \n  When the search is extended by the user, more matching results are returned that are linked to the ICD-10-CM R69. If the user still does not find the desired term, the user may choose to enter a free text entry by selecting the Freetext Problem button.\n   \n  6.      If the user does not find the desired term using the Extend Search they may choose to enter a free text entry, the user may choose to do the following actions.\n  \n   \n  \n    To refine your search, select No and return to step 4. To use this term, select Yes and go to step 7.\n  \n   \n  \n    o     \n    Terms Found But Not Adequate:\n    If the extended search displays terms, but not the one you want, you will need to decide whether to enter a free-text term or revise your search.\n  \n  \n    To begin the search again using another term, return to step 4 and use another term to identify the problem.\n  \n  \n    To enter a free-text term, select the Freetext Term button. The Unresolved Entry dialog will display as shown below:\n  \n  \n  \n    This dialog shows when the system does not find any terms that match the text entered by the provider or when the provider selects the Freetext button because an adequate term is not displayed. From the Unresolved Entry dialog, the provi\n    der can choose to use the term as entered, and if needed, request that it be added as a new term.\n  \n  \n    To use this term, you first need to decide if you want to request that the term you entered be added as a new term. To request a new term, you need to check the Request New Term check box and add a comment if needed. If not, leave the check box unchecked. Then, to add this term to the Problem List as entered, select Yes and go to step 8.\n  \n  \n    Note:      \n    If you request a new term, a bulletin is sent to a local group for\n    review. This group will then forward the request if it concurs that a new term is needed.\n  \n   \n  \n    o     \n    No Terms Found:\n    If the extended search finds no terms, the Unresolved Entry dialog will display as shown below.

Only documents created after \n the installation of these patches will have copied and pasted text tracked.\nExcessive copying and pasting has at least these \n impacts on healthcare:\n\n\tunnecessary \n\t duplication of information\n\tlengthening \n\t of notes and making chart reading more difficult\n\tslowing \n\t the retrieval of notes by the workstation\n\timproving \n\t accuracy of the note and the patient information\n\n \nTo help sites better audit what text is copied and \n pasted into clinical documents, CPRS defines\n\n\twho \n\t can view pasted text\n\twhat \n\t constitutes tracked pasted text\n\thow \n\t CPRS will display pasted text\n\thow \n\t the auditor can view the pasted text\n\thow the person auditing can turn on or \n\t off the display of pasted text \n\n \nWho Can View Pasted Text?\nAfter signature, only individuals assigned to specific \n user classes will be able to view text that has been copied and pasted. \n With CPRS v31b, users in these User Classes are assigned to be able to \n audit copying and pasting by default:\n\n\tCHIEF, MIS\n\tCHIEF, HIMS\n\tPRIVACY ACT OFFICER\n\nIn addition, sites can give other user classes the \n ability to view copy/paste data.\n \nWhat \n Constitutes Tracked Paste?\nIf a user pastes text into a clinical document within \n CPRS, CPRS will track that as a paste if it meets several criteria. When \n a user copies information within VistA or CPRS, CPRS will store characteristics \n about the copied text if it is available, such as the title and author \n of the document it came from, or whatever information it can about the \n source. The information gathered when text is copied can then be displayed \n if the text is pasted.\nIf text is copied from outside of CPRS or it is altered \n after being pasted into CPRS, the source information may simply read “Outside \n of current CPRS tracking”, meaning that CPRS does not know where it came \n from.\n \nCharacter Limits for Pasted \n Text\nA 20,000 character limit is hard-coded. If a paste \n exceeds 20,000 characters, CPRS will not try to track the source. It will \n still show on the report and the percentage will be calculated as discussed \n below. The text will still be tracked, but it will not be able to track \n the source.\n \nOther Copy/Paste \n Characteristics that Sites Can Set\nThere are several criteria that determine whether \n a copy and paste will be tracked or displayed with identifying marks in \n CPRS. Sites have some control over how these criteria are set. The criteria \n are as follows:\n\n\tMinimum Number of Words: \n\t To be considered a paste, there must be at least the specified number \n\t of words. For example, if it is set at 15 words and a user pastes \n\t 14, CPRS will not identify it as a paste. The default is 5 words.\n\tPercentage Check: Because \n\t providers often edit text after it is pasted, CPRS checks what percentage \n\t of the original paste is in the document. For example, if this percentage \n\t is set at 85 percent and the user pastes some text but then edits \n\t it so that only 75 percent of the original text remains, it will not \n\t display as pasted text. The default is 90% unless changed by your \n\t site.\n\tRole: Until a note is signed, \n\t the author and cosigner can see highlighted pasted text. After the \n\t note is signed, only users in specified user classes will see the \n\t pasted text.\n\tExclude Note Title: Site \n\t can specify notes that will not be tracked for copy/paste.\n\tExclude Application: Sites \n\t can specify that specified applications are not tracked for copy/paste. \n\t One application (natspeak.exe) is already included in this parameter.\n\nClinical Application Coordinators (CACs) set the \n values for these parameters.\n \nWhen Text Will Not Display \n as Pasted\nIn addition to these parameters, certain actions \n will determine whether pasted text displays in CPRS with its identifiers.\n\n\tAfter Signature: While the \n\t author of a note is writing the note or editing it, CPRS will identify \n\t pasted text with highlighting or other methods as set by the user, \n\t if it meets the criteria above. If the author or cosigner of the document \n\t signs the document and they are not in the designated user class that \n\t can view pasted text, the pasted text will no longer be identified \n\t for them as pasted.

The Blood Components and Diagnostic Test Orders dialog has three tabs: Patient Information, Orders, and Lab Results. Because this dialog is modal, meaning that it stays on top of CPRS, these tabs enable the provider to have the necessary information at the time of ordering.\nIf the user selects an item under the Order tab's Write Orders pane or from an order menu, the Blood Components and Diagnostic Test Order Form dialog opens to the Patient Information tab. But, if the user selects a quick order that is not an auto-accept quick order or elects to edit or copy an existing order, the dialog will open to the Blood Bank Orders tab.\nYou can either read this entire section or go to the specific area of interest using the links below:\n· VBECS Patient Information tab\n· VBECS Blood Bank Orders tab\n· VBECS Lab Test Results tab\n \nThe Patient Information Tab\nThe Patient Information tab displays identifying information for the selected patient (name, social security number, and blood type), along with the following information:\n·       Lab Specimen - The Lab Specimen ID number and the expiration date for the specimen taken from the patient for diagnostic tests, such as type and screen. The expiration is 3 days from the time the specimen was accessioned. 3 days is a default that sites can change using a CPRS parameter.\n·      Antibodies Identified -  Any antibodies identified in the type and screen are displayed here.\n·      Transfusion Requirements - VBECS provides any necessary instructions or needs for transfusion display here.\n·      Transfusion Reactions - Any reactions the patient had during a transfusion are shown here.\n·      Available Units\no      Unit ID - The blood bank number assigned to the unit.\no      Component - This shows the type of component.\no      Status - There are 4 statuses:\n§    Assigned - A unit identified for a patient, but has not been crossmatched.\n§    Crossmatched - The unit has been designated as typed and crossed.\n§    Autologous -  The unit is the patient blood that was previously donated for the patient’s use.\n§    Directed - This unit was donated with the intention that it would be given to this patient.\n \no Expiration Date - This date represents when the unit is no longer good.\no Division - The name of the division where the blood component is located.\n \nLinks to items in this topic:\n· VBECS Patient Information tab\n· VBECS Blood Bank Orders tab\n· VBECS Lab Test Results tab\n· Back to the top\n \nThe Blood Bank Orders Tab\nOn the Blood Bank Orders tab, providers can place orders for blood components and diagnostic tests that need to be done before the components can be given to the patient. As with many types of orders, the user can create personal quick orders for blood components and tests the user frequently orders.\nOn this dialog, the user specifies:\n·      Blood Components – The list of items comes from CPRS from a parameter and shows what blood products can be offered. Items might include:\no   Red blood cells\no   Fresh frozen plasma\no   Platelets\no   Cryoprecipitate\no   Whole blood\no   Other\n \n·      Modifiers - The modifiers are controlled by a parameter that is set at each site. It might include things such as washed, irradiated, etc.\n·      Date/Time Wanted* - The date and time when the blood component should be ready that enables the user to order the blood for a future date, such as for a surgery.\n·      Urgency* - This list comes from CPRS and might include items such as Routine, Pre-Op, ASAP, or STAT. The urgency applies to all components and diagnostic tests listed under the Selected Components and Tests area.\n·      Surgery (conditional) - If the user selects Pre-Op for the urgency, the Surgery field becomes active and the provider can select the surgery to be performed from the drop-down list or enter it manually. If the surgery is not listed, the provider may enter a surgery (the field accepts free-text) because this is not a comprehensive list of surgeries.\n·      Reason for Request* - The user can choose a reason from the drop-down list (sites define items in the list using a parameter) or type a free-text entry. This reason for request applies to the entire order.\n·      Comment* - If the provider has information that should be passed on with the order, the comments can be added in this field. The comments apply to the entire order. (This is a required field if the user selects the Blood Component \"Other\".)\n·      Diagnostic Tests - The items on this list comes from CPRS and enable the provider to request specific tests associated with blood component ordering. When the user selects this item, the fields under blood components are then cleared. The user can see those items again by highlighting the blood component under Selected Blood Components and Tests.\n·      Collection Type* - The collection type determines how the specimen should be collected: Lab collect, Ward collect, Send patient to Lab, or Immediate collect, for example.\n·      Collection Date/Time* - The date and time enable the user to specify when the sample should be collected.\n \nItems required to order each blood component or diagnostic test are marked with an asterisk (*) after the name of the field, such as Reason for Request*.\nHow the Blood Orders Tab Works\nOrdering blood components and diagnostic tests is different than ordering other items in CPRS because users can place orders for several different blood components and tests in one dialog at the same time. For example, if a user wanted to order platelets, whole blood, and a type and screen, the user could do all of that in the dialog at the same time. To accommodate ordering of multiple items, the Blood Bank Orders tab creates a list of items ordered under the Selected Components and Test area.\nWhen the user selects a blood component from the Blood Component drop-down list, the item is immediately added to the Selected Components and Tests area (think of this as a shopping cart like some web sites use). The user can then detail the necessary information for that component, such as quantity, modifiers, date and time wanted, the urgency and reason for request, etc.\nWhen the user puts in data for these fields, these values will stay in when the user switches between components or tests. Because the values that apply to the entire order continue to display, the user can select items and enter the other values for each component and diagnostic test.\nAlternatively, the user could select all of the components and tests first, then select each item under the Selected Components and Tests list and fill in each individually. To edit any item, the user must either fill in the fields as soon as the item is selected from the drop-down list, or highlight the item in the Selected Components and Tests list and then edit the fields.\nUnder the Selected Components and Test area, the user can also remove a single item by selecting the item and selecting the Remove button, or if the user wants to remove all the items, the user can select the Remove All button.\nBased on the set up, CPRS may prompt the user that the selected blood component requires a specific diagnostic test. For example, if the user selects whole blood and the patient does not have a Type and Screen within the last 3 days (3 days is a default, clinical coordinators at the sites can set the number of days based on local policy), the user will see a message under the diagnostic test drop-down box stating that a Type and Screen is required.\nAs the user enters orders, the order text is built in the field at the bottom of the dialog. Thus, the user should review this area to ensure that all necessary information is included with each item.\nTo help the user edit the values that go along with each component and test, several values that apply to the entire order now remain visible:\n· component Date/Time Wanted\n· diagnostic test Collection Type\n· diagnostic test Collection Date/Time\n· Comments\n· Reason for Request\n· Urgency\n \nThe date wanted can be set for all blood components and also defaults for the diagnostic tests. Modifiers apply only to blood components.\nAlso, when the user moves the focus to either the Blood Components or the Diagnostic Tests area, values for the last item entered in that area display so that user can edit the values. If the user wants to edit another item, the user must select it from the Selected Components and Test area first.\nConfiguring the VBECS Dialog\nEach site can configure some areas of the Blood Component and Diagnostic Test Order Form dialog. A CPRS parameter lets sites decide if the Blood Component area or the Diagnostic Test area is shown on the left of the dialog. The other area then displays next to the first area on the right of the dialog.\nSites can also customize the order of the following lists:\n· The Blood Components\n· The Diagnostic Tests\n· The Reason for Request\n \nThe order of items in these lists is controlled by parameters set by Clinical Application Coordinators (CACs). CACs can therefore put the most used items earlier in the list.\n \nLinks to items in this topic:\n· VBECS Patient Information tab\n· VBECS Blood Bank Orders tab\n· VBECS Lab Test Results tab\n· Back to the top\n \n \nThe Lab Results Tab\nThe Lab Results tab enables clinicians to view the lab results associated with the selected blood component. If there are lab results in the system when the user selects a blood component, the tab name changes to Lab Results Available. This tab then shows the results from the lab tests designated in VBECS by the administrator at each site. So, for example, the user might see different lab test results based on whether the user selected whole blood or platelets.\nNote:      The most recent results are displayed, but these results may be from test done some time in the past. Users should use good judgment as to whether they should order a new test.\n \nLinks to items in this topic:\n· VBECS Patient Information tab\n· VBECS Blood Bank Orders tab\n· VBECS Lab Test Results tab\n· Back to the top\n \nRelated Topics\nHow to Write Orders\nOrdering Blood Components and Diagnostic Tests\n\n\n","Path::contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Viewing_a_Health_Summary.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Viewing_a_Health_Summary.htm"},{"origLink":"Viewing_a_Report.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Viewing_a_Report.htm"}],"Path::contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm::Title":"Available Reports on the Reports Tab","Path::contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Available reports,Date,Date:range,Department of Defense,DoD,FHIE,GCPR,Read-only,Reports,Reports:Reports-only: CPRS Read Only,Reports:available in CPRS,Health:Factors","Path::contents/Available_Reports_on_the_Reports_Tab.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Available Reports on the Reports Tab\n  \n  \n    The table below lists the reports available from the Reports tab\n    .

From within the patient's CPRS medical record, the clinician enters an order for a consultation or procedure. The ordering clinician may first have to enter Encounter Information.\n2.     The consult service receives an alert and a printed SF 513. The receiving service can then accept the consult, forward it to another service, or send it back to the originating clinician for more information.\n3.     The consult service accepts or rejects the consult request. To accept the consult, the service uses the receive action. The service can also discontinue or cancel the consult. Cancelled consults can be edited and resubmitted by the ordering clinician. A consult service clinician sees the patient.\nThe consult service enters results and comments. Resulting is primarily handled through TIU.\n4.     The originating clinician receives a CONSULT/REQUEST UPDATED alert that the consult is complete. The results can now be examined and further action can be taken on behalf of the patient.\n5.     The SF 513 report becomes part of the patient's medical record. A hard copy can be filed and the electronic copy is on line for paperless access.\n6.     Results from the Medicine package can be attached to complete consults involving procedures. This function is available through the GUI for the Consults package, but will only be seen when the supporting Consults patch GMRC*3.0*15 is installed. The absence of these patches will result only in the function not being present.\n7.     If Consults patch GMRC*3.0*18 has been installed, the Edit/Resubmit action is available for cancelled consults. The consult must be \"resubmittable\" and the user must be authorized to resubmit consults.\n8.     The Consults tab has a list of consults in a tree view similar to the ones found on the Notes tab and the Discharge Summary tab. However, the list view feature is not available due to differences in the tabs functions. Consults are differentiated from procedures in the tree by the type of icon displayed. Consults are represented by a notepad icon while procedures are represented by a caduceus-like icon.\n9.     Right-click in the Consults text and you may select the \"Find in Selected Consult\" option from the popup menu.

Clinic Infusions enable VistA order checks to function for such medication orders.\nClinic Infusions orders must be placed from a clinic location. When providers select the Clinic Infusions item under the Write Order pane, CPRS will ask the providers to confirm that they are placing a Clinic Infusions order. Either before or after the confirmation dialog appears, providers must assign the encounter location to an appropriate clinic. For outpatients, providers will be prompted if no encounter location has been defined yet and then asked to confirm that they want to order Clinic Medications. For inpatients, providers will be asked to confirm that they want to order Clinic Medications first and then prompted for an appropriate clinic location.\nOther than being ordered from a clinic, the infusion ordering process is almost identical to ordering infusions from any other location. However, to be comprehensive, the steps for Clinic Infusions should be complete in this section of the manual. As they are almost identical, the information in this section is the same as much of the information under the infusions ordering section.\n \nContinuous versus Intermittent Infusion Orders\nIn the Infusion Order dialog, the order type—Continuous or Intermittent— affects whether some fields are available or visible. The two types of IVs are defined as follows:\n\nContinuous IV: an IV that runs at a specified rate (ml/hr, mcg/kg/min, etc.).\nIntermittent IV: an IV administered at scheduled intervals (Q4H, QDAY) or One-Time only, “over a specified period of time” (e.g., “Infuse over 30 min.”).\n\n \nFor Intermittent orders, the Infusion Rate field changes to be Infuse over Time, the Schedule field becomes available (not greyed out), and checkboxes display for the PRN and Give additional Dose Now options. On both dialogs, required fields are identified by an asterisk following the field label (such as Route*, for example). Intermittent orders no longer require a solution to finish the order. Continuous orders still require a solution before the order can be finished. For CPRS to accept the order, the user must enter values in the required fields, including the units.\nFor the Route field, CPRS uses the following rules to define whether it displays a default route for the selected medication:\n\nIf all of the orderable items on the order have the same default medication route defined, CPRS designates the default medication route in the selection list.\nIf one or more orderable items on the order have different default medication routes, no medication route in the selection list will be denoted as the default.\n\n \nRelated Topics\nOne-Step Clinic Administration for IV Medications\nPlacing Continuous Clinic Infusion Orders\nPlacing Intermittent Clinic Infusion Orders\n\n\n","Path::contents/Clinic_Medications_(Overview).htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Clinic_Medications_(Overview).htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"assets/images/Clinic_medications_display_group_cropped_2015-02-10.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Clinic_Medications_(Overview).htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Clinic_medications_display_group_cropped_2015-02-10.gif"},{"origLink":"image/CPRS0071.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Clinic_Medications_(Overview).htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/image/CPRS0071.gif"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Simple_Clinic_Medications.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Clinic_Medications_(Overview).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Simple_Clinic_Medications.htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Complex_Clinic_Medications.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Clinic_Medications_(Overview).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Complex_Clinic_Medications.htm"},{"origLink":"Sorting_the_Medications_View.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Clinic_Medications_(Overview).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Sorting_the_Medications_View.htm"},{"origLink":"Changing_or_Copying_Clinic_Orders.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Clinic_Medications_(Overview).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Changing_or_Copying_Clinic_Orders.htm"}],"Path::contents/Clinic_Medications_(Overview).htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Clinic_Medications_(Overview).htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Clinic_Medications_(Overview).htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Clinic_Medications_(Overview).htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Clinic_Medications_(Overview).htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Clinic_Medications_(Overview).htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Clinic_Medications_(Overview).htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Clinic_Medications_(Overview).htm::Title":"Clinic Medications (Overview)","Path::contents/Clinic_Medications_(Overview).htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Inpatient Meds,Inpatient Meds:for outpatient,Medications,Medications:ordering inpatient for outpatient,Orders,Orders:inpatient for outpatient,Clinic:medications","Path::contents/Clinic_Medications_(Overview).htm::InnerText":"\nClinic Medications (Overview)\nClinic Medications enables a CPRS user to order unit-dose medications that are dispensed by inpatient pharmacy and administered to a patient in a clinic setting, as well as nursing text orders. Clinic Orders also use VistA order checks.\nOn the Orders tab, CPRS displays these medications and Nursing text orders under a new display group named Clinic Medications. To show under the Clinic Medications display group, Nursing text orders must be written from a clinic location. If they are not ordered from a clinic location, the Nursing text orders will display under the Nursing display group. This includes text orders that are part of an order set.\nNote:        If Clinic Nursing orders do not display where expected, they may not be set up properly. IRM or CAC personnel should check the CPRS Technical Manual: GUI Version for more information.\n \n\nThis example shows the Order tab with a unit dose and nursing text order--that appear under the Clinic Medications display group.\n \nOn the Meds tab, Clinic medication orders of all statuses except unreleased orders display at the top of the Inpatient Medications pane before other inpatient medications orders. Nursing text orders do not display on the Meds tab. User can distinguish Clinic orders because they have an entry in the Location column of the Meds tab display.\nNote:      Clinic Medication orders are affected by both CPRS auto-DC rules and Inpatient Medications rules for auto-discontinuing orders on admission and discharge. If sites do not want Clinic orders to auto-discontinue on admission and discharge, sites will have to ensure that neither CPRS nor Inpatient Medications discontinues Clinic orders. Inpatient Medications uses the AUTO-DC IMO ORDERS parameter to exclude Clinic orders from being discontinued.\n \nCriteria for Ordering Clinic Medications\nTo successfully write an Clinic order, the encounter must be in a clinic location.\nNote:      To create a new visit, select the Provider/Encounter button (shown below), select the Visit tab, select New, and then select OK.\n \n\nIn addition, before you can use the Meds tab to place Clinic orders, your site's CAC (or the person who manages information resources at your site) must set up the new medication order dialog to include inpatient medications.\n \nRelated Topics\nOrdering Simple Clinic Medications\nOrdering Complex Clinic Medications\nSorting the Medications View\nChanging or Copying Clinic Orders\n\n\n","Path::contents/Closing_a_Patient_Record.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Closing_a_Patient_Record.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Review___Sign_Changes_Dialog.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Closing_a_Patient_Record.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Review___Sign_Changes_Dialog.htm"},{"origLink":"Selecting_a_Patient.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Closing_a_Patient_Record.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Selecting_a_Patient.htm"},{"origLink":"Selecting_a_Patient.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Closing_a_Patient_Record.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Selecting_a_Patient.htm"}],"Path::contents/Closing_a_Patient_Record.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Closing_a_Patient_Record.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Closing_a_Patient_Record.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Closing_a_Patient_Record.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Closing_a_Patient_Record.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Closing_a_Patient_Record.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Closing_a_Patient_Record.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Closing_a_Patient_Record.htm::Title":"Closing a Patient Record","Path::contents/Closing_a_Patient_Record.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Closing a Patient Record,Closing a Patient Record:manually,Patient,Patient:records (closing),Records,Records:closing","Path::contents/Closing_a_Patient_Record.htm::InnerText":"\nClosing a Patient Record\nYou can close a patient record in different ways.

In simple terms, this means that if CCOW-compliant applications are sharing context and one of the applications changes to a different patient, the other applications will change to that patient as well.\nThe VA purchased Sentillion's Vergence context management software to work with VistA.\nTo use the CCOW standard, VistA set up must include these two components:\n·     a context vault, which is a server on the VA LAN that tracks context for each clinical workstation\n·     desktop components installed on each workstation that will use CCOW\n \nTo allow VistA GUI applications to use context management, the developers must make the necessary changes to HL7 messages for each application to allow synchronization. Current plans call for the following applications to be CCOW-compliant:\n·     CPRS *\n·     HealtheVet Desktop (Care Management) *\n·     Imaging *\n·     Clinical Procedures\n·     BCMA (Bar Code Medication Administration)\n·     Vitals\n·     FIM (Functional Independence Measure)\n·     Scheduling\n* These applications will be made CCOW compliant first.\n \nCPRS has been made CCOW-compliant and can now synchronize with other VistA CCOW-compliant applications. The first three applications that will be CCOW-compliant are CPRS, Care Management, and Imaging. Care Management provides one example of applications synchronization. If you were in Care Management, which is also CCOW-compliant, and clicked the CPRS Chart link, the CPRS GUI chart would be launched and would bring up the same patient that had focus in Care Management. You can also have two CPRS sessions synchronized. And, of course, you can bring up two different CPRS sessions and not synchronize them, thus allowing you to view two patients' charts at the same time.\nThe CCOW icon shows whether the current application is linked with others on the desktop.\n\nThe above graphic shows the CCOW icon in outlined in red at the far left of the chart.\n \nCPRS enables users to join or break context with other applications. The icon displays whether CPRS is joined in context or not. The following three icons will display based on the CCOW state:\n Linked\n \n Broken\n \n Changing\nNote:      There are a few cases when you cannot change context, such as when a print dialog is open or when you are trying to open an application from the Tools menu. If you try to change context with unsigned orders or notes, the Problem Changing Clinical Data dialog display and tell the user if there are items that will not be signed. Another dialog display if there is a contextor problem.\n \nRelated Topics\nJoining Context\nBreaking Context\n\n\n","Path::contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Copying_Document_Templates.htm#EH91WC","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm"},{"origLink":"Copying_Document_Templates.htm#EH91WC","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm"},{"origLink":"Document_Templates_(overview).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Document_Templates_(overview).htm"},{"origLink":"Creating_Personal_Document_Templates.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Creating_Personal_Document_Templates.htm"},{"origLink":"Creating_Shared_Document_Templates.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Creating_Shared_Document_Templates.htm"},{"origLink":"Editing_Document_Templates.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Editing_Document_Templates.htm"},{"origLink":"Searching_for_Document_Templates.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Searching_for_Document_Templates.htm"},{"origLink":"Deleting_Document_Templates.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Deleting_Document_Templates.htm"},{"origLink":"Copying_Document_Templates.htm#A384IZE","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm"},{"origLink":"Document_Templates_(overview).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Document_Templates_(overview).htm"},{"origLink":"Creating_Personal_Document_Templates.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Creating_Personal_Document_Templates.htm"},{"origLink":"Creating_Shared_Document_Templates.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Creating_Shared_Document_Templates.htm"},{"origLink":"Editing_Document_Templates.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Editing_Document_Templates.htm"},{"origLink":"Searching_for_Document_Templates.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Searching_for_Document_Templates.htm"},{"origLink":"Deleting_Document_Templates.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Deleting_Document_Templates.htm"}],"Path::contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm::Bookmarks":[{"id":"A384IZE","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"A384IZE"},{"id":"EH91WC","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"EH91WC"}],"Path::contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm::Title":"Copying Document Templates","Path::contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Template:copying document templates","Path::contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm::InnerText":"\nCopying Document Templates\nUsers can copy a shared template into their personal templates.

conventions are divided into three categories:\n· Standard Windows objects\n· Form buttons\n· Changing the size of Windows\nSelect one of these categories to see a list of all of the items in that category. Then, click on the item to go to the definition. To return to the top of this document, click the Back button once or twice as needed.\n \nStandard Windows Objects\nThese types of data entry fields are located in standard Windows forms:\n· Check box\n· Command button\n· Date field\n· Drop down list\n· Faded Background\n· Keyboard commands\n· List box\n· Lookup box\n· Memo field\n· Non-white background\n· Radio button\n· Right mouse button or Shift F10\n· Tab key\n· Text box\n \nCheck Box\nToggles between a YES/NO, ON/OFF setting. Usually a square box containing a check mark or x. Clicking the box or pressing the spacebar toggles the check box setting.\n \nCommand Button\nThe Command button initiates an action. It is a rectangular box with a label that specifies what the button does. Command buttons that end with three dots indicate that a subsidiary screen may be evoked by selecting the command.\n \nDate Field\nIdentified by \"__/__/__\" or a date \"mm/dd/yy\". Will usually have an associated pop-up calendar. Double clicking with the mouse inside the date edit box, or tabbing to the edit box and then pressing the F2 key, displays the calendar. Clicking on the desired date, or using the arrow keys to move to a date and then pressing the spacebar, selects the date. Each component of the date (month/day/year) must consist of two characters (i.e., 02/02/96). The selected entry will not be effective until you tab off or exit from the date field.\n \nDrop Down List\nA list box containing an arrow button on the right side which displays one entry at a time. Choose from a vertical list of choices. Select the entry you want by clicking the list entry. You cannot type in this box, only select an item from the list. Once an entry is selected, it cannot be deleted - only changed. If <None> is the last entry, selecting it will clear the list entry. If <More> is the last entry, selecting it will display additional entries. The selected entry will not be effective until you tab off or exit from the drop down list.\n \nFaded Background\nFields that appear with a faded background are currently disabled.\n \nKeyboard Commands\nMost actions on the CPRS screens can be performed with keyboard commands.\n \nList Box\nBox which shows a list of items. If more items exist than can be seen in the box, a scroll bar appears on the side of the box. Selecting an entry from a list box requires either double clicking the entry or single clicking the entry and pressing the spacebar.\n \nLookup Box\nChoose from a vertical list of choices. By typing in a few characters and pressing the ENTER or TAB key, a list of matching entries drops down. Select the entry you want by clicking the list entry. Entering a question mark and then pressing ENTER or TAB, or clicking the down arrow on an empty edit field, gives a complete listing of available entries. If <More> is the last entry, selecting it will display additional entries.\n \nMemo Field\nThis field is equivalent to a word-processing field.\n \nNon-White Background\nItems in fields that appear with a non-white background can be selected but cannot be modified directly in that field.\n \nRadio Button\nRadio buttons appear in sets. Each button represents a single choice and only one button may be selected at any one time. For example, MALE or FEMALE may be offered as choices through two radio buttons. Click in the button to select it.\n \nRight Mouse Button or Shift F10\nYou may click the right mouse button or press Shift F10 for a pop-up box of menu items.\n \nTab Key\nUse the TAB key or the mouse to move between fields. Do not use the RETURN key. The RETURN key is usually reserved for the default command button or action (except in menu fields).\n \nText Box\nType the desired characters into the text box. The selected entry will not be effective until you tab off or exit from the text box.\n \nForm Buttons\nButtons that appear on tab pages apply only to that tab and not the entire form. If there are action buttons on both the tab page and the form, the tab button should normally be clicked first. Note that every button has an associated menu bar command but not every menu bar command has an associated button.\n \n· Add\n· Cancel\n· Close\n· Help\n· OK\n· Save\n· Undo\n \nAdd\nAnytime you reach a screen and the ADD button is enabled, you must first click the ADD button before entering any information.\n \nCancel\nCancels the latest entry (up until the OK or SAVE button is clicked).\n \nClose\nCloses the window. If there are any changes that have not been saved, you will get a confirmation message asking you if you want to continue without saving; save before exiting; or cancel the close action and return to the window.\n \nHelp\nThe Help Menu provides a table of contents, an index, or search to get to help for the area you are currently working in. *You can also click the right mouse button or press the F1 key for context-sensitive help (i.e., help that applies specifically to the area you are working in, such as a dialog box).\n*not available yet\n \nOK\nAdds the new entry after the data has been entered.\n \nSave\nSaves all changes made since the last save action. If you attempt to save and all required fields have not yet been completed, you will receive notification that the required fields must be completed before saving.\n \nUndo\nUndoes all changes made since the last save action and redisplays the original data.\n \nChanging the size of windows:\nYou can change the size of most CPRS windows using typical Windows conventions:\n \n· Position the mouse pointer over the side bar and drag out to make the window wider\n· Position the mouse pointer over the right-bottom corner and drag diagonally to increase the whole size of the window\n· Position the mouse pointer over the vertical panel divider and drag left or right to increase or decrease the size of either panel. For Example, in the window below, the left-hand panel which lists All Consults is too narrow to show all the information about each Consult. If you drag the dividing line to the right, you can see more data.\n\n\n","Path::contents/CPRS_Help_Introduction.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/CPRS_Help_Introduction.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"#CIS","attr":"href","topic":"contents/CPRS_Help_Introduction.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/CPRS_Help_Introduction.htm"},{"origLink":"#showhide","attr":"href","topic":"contents/CPRS_Help_Introduction.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/CPRS_Help_Introduction.htm"},{"origLink":"#using_CIS","attr":"href","topic":"contents/CPRS_Help_Introduction.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/CPRS_Help_Introduction.htm"},{"origLink":"assets/images/2013_02_11_Help_with_ActiveX_problem.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/CPRS_Help_Introduction.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/2013_02_11_Help_with_ActiveX_problem.gif"},{"origLink":"assets/images/2013_02_11_Help_with_contents_showing.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/CPRS_Help_Introduction.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/2013_02_11_Help_with_contents_showing.gif"},{"origLink":"assets/images/2013_02_11_Help_with_contents_showing.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/CPRS_Help_Introduction.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/2013_02_11_Help_with_contents_showing.gif"},{"origLink":"assets/images/2013-03-14_help_with_hover_hints.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/CPRS_Help_Introduction.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/2013-03-14_help_with_hover_hints.gif"},{"origLink":"assets/images/2013-03-14_help_search_hover_hints.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/CPRS_Help_Introduction.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/2013-03-14_help_search_hover_hints.gif"}],"Path::contents/CPRS_Help_Introduction.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/CPRS_Help_Introduction.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/CPRS_Help_Introduction.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/CPRS_Help_Introduction.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/CPRS_Help_Introduction.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/CPRS_Help_Introduction.htm::Bookmarks":[{"id":"CIS","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"CIS"},{"id":"showhide","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"showhide"},{"id":"using_CIS","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"using_CIS"}],"Path::contents/CPRS_Help_Introduction.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/CPRS_Help_Introduction.htm::Title":"CPRS Help Introduction","Path::contents/CPRS_Help_Introduction.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"CPRS:CPRS Help Introduction","Path::contents/CPRS_Help_Introduction.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Help Introduction\n  \n  Welcome to the help system for the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).

You should also make the name descriptive of the content for ease of use.\n3.     Select the template type: Folder.\n4.     Select and drag the templates that related to the folder you created.\nNote:      You do not have to click Apply after each template, but it is recommended because if you click Cancel, you will lose all changes you have made since the last time you clicked Apply or OK.\n \nBack to the top\n \nRelated topics\nDocument Templates (overview)\nGenerating a Template from a TIU Object or Note Title\nCreating Personal Document Templates\nEditing Document Templates\nCopying Document Templates\nSearching for Document Templates\nDeleting Document Templates\n\n\n\n","Path::contents/Customizing_CPRS_(general).htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Customizing_CPRS_(general).htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Patient_Lists.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Customizing_CPRS_(general).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Patient_Lists.htm"},{"origLink":"Quick_Orders.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Customizing_CPRS_(general).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Quick_Orders.htm"},{"origLink":"Order_Sets.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Customizing_CPRS_(general).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Order_Sets.htm"},{"origLink":"Notifications__Notifications_and_Alerts.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Customizing_CPRS_(general).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Notifications__Notifications_and_Alerts.htm"},{"origLink":"Order_Checking.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Customizing_CPRS_(general).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Order_Checking.htm"},{"origLink":"Tools_Menu.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Customizing_CPRS_(general).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Tools_Menu.htm"}],"Path::contents/Customizing_CPRS_(general).htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Customizing_CPRS_(general).htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Customizing_CPRS_(general).htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Customizing_CPRS_(general).htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Customizing_CPRS_(general).htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Customizing_CPRS_(general).htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Customizing_CPRS_(general).htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Customizing_CPRS_(general).htm::Title":"Customizing CPRS (general)","Path::contents/Customizing_CPRS_(general).htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Cover Sheet,Customizing,Customizing:CPRS (general),Notifications","Path::contents/Customizing_CPRS_(general).htm::InnerText":"\nCustomizing CPRS\nYou can customize CPRS in the following ways:\n·      Change font size\nTo change the font size, select Edit | Preferences, then choose a different font size.\n·      Change the date ranges for items that appear on the Cover Sheet\n·      Change your patient list\n·      Add Quick Orders or Order Sets\n·      Change your notifications and the way they behave\n·      Add or delete your order checks\n·      Change printing formats and other parameters (Check with your Clinical Coordinator or IRM specialist.)\n·      Make other programs (e.g., non-VA applications such as Excel) accessible through the Tools menu\n\n\n","Path::contents/DEA_ePCS_Error_Messages_and_Troubleshooting.htm::Links":[],"Path::contents/DEA_ePCS_Error_Messages_and_Troubleshooting.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/DEA_ePCS_Error_Messages_and_Troubleshooting.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/DEA_ePCS_Error_Messages_and_Troubleshooting.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/DEA_ePCS_Error_Messages_and_Troubleshooting.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/DEA_ePCS_Error_Messages_and_Troubleshooting.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/DEA_ePCS_Error_Messages_and_Troubleshooting.htm::Bookmarks":[{"id":"DEA_troubleshooting","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"DEA_troubleshooting"}],"Path::contents/DEA_ePCS_Error_Messages_and_Troubleshooting.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/DEA_ePCS_Error_Messages_and_Troubleshooting.htm::Title":"DEA ePCS Error Messages and Troubleshooting","Path::contents/DEA_ePCS_Error_Messages_and_Troubleshooting.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"DEA,DEA:error messages and troubleshooting,Error,Troubleshooting","Path::contents/DEA_ePCS_Error_Messages_and_Troubleshooting.htm::InnerText":"\nDEA ePCS Error Messages and Troubleshooting\nThis section includes general information regarding signing outpatient controlled substance orders for the Electronic Prescribing of Controlled Substance features (ePCS), errors the user might see, and some possible causes.\n\nPossible hardware problems:\n\n\nThe card reader is not working. To check, try the user’s card in another workstation’s card reader.\nThe card is damaged or broken. To check, insert the card into a reader that you know works.\n\n \n\nWhat does a user need to be able to digitally sign outpatient controlled substances prescriptions?\n\nProviders must have the following to be able to prescribe outpatient controlled substance medication orders:\n\n\nMust be an active user\n\n\nMust have the provider key\n\n\nMust be authorized to write medications  in File 200\n\n\nMust have the ORES key\n\n\nDEA# (that has not expired, but a date must be entered), VA#, or Maint/Detox#\n\n\nAssigned Pharmacy schedules for which the provider can prescribe (some combination of schedules 2-5, or all schedules 2-5)\n\n\nThe ePCS USER ENABLE/DISABLE option enabled\n\n\nPIV or smart card and PIN\n\n\nSubject Alternative Name (SAN), usually the user’s Outlook email address, which  must be linked from the PIV or smart card to the user’s VistA account\n\n\n \n\nIs the user prescribing from a remote location?\n\nThe ActivClient software must be installed on the remote workstation or ePCS will not work.\n \n\nWhat do the error messages that the user might see during the signing process mean?\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nError Message\n\n\nCause\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\n\nOrder for controlled substance could not be completed. Provider does not have a current, valid DEA# on record and is ineligible to sign the order.\n\n\nThere is no DEA Number in file200 for this provider. Contact your CAC or support person who can check on this for you.\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\n\nOrder for controlled substance could not be completed.\nProvider is not authorized to prescribe medications in Federal Schedule X [X is one of 2, 2N, 3, 3N, 4, or 5].\n\n\nIn the provider’s set up, they have not been assigned permission to write for the specified schedule. Your CAC should know who is responsible for assigning the schedules.\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\n\nOrder for controlled substance could not be completed.\nProvider does not have a valid Detoxification/Maintenance ID number on record and is ineligible to sign the order.\n\n\nThe provider does not have a Detoxification/Maintenance number entered in file 200 or there is a problem with it. Contact your ADPAC or CAC to find out who enters credentialing information through the Data Entry for ePrescribing Controlled Substances application to get this corrected.\n\n\n\n\n4.\n\n\nOrder for controlled substance could not be completed.\nProvider’s DEA# expired on DATE [ex:JAN 01, 2012] and no VA# is assigned. Provider is ineligible to sign the order.\n \n\n\nThe text is clear. The provider’s DEA number has expired and the provider does not have a VA number.

Provider is ineligible to sign the order.\n\n\nAgain, the error text gives a good explanation. The provider has a valid Detoxifcation/Maintenance number, but because the user’s DEA number has expired, the Detox/Maintenance number cannot be used.

Cannot Digitally Sign.\n\n\nThe card is locked in CPRS after 3 failed attempts at PIN entry. This error occurs when the user tries to sign while the card is locked. It will be automatically unlocked after 15 minutes.\nWarning: Be careful! 5 consecutive PIN entry attempts will lock the card and you will have to go to your PIV office to resolve the situation.\n\n\n\n\n10.\n\n\nDigital Signing has been cancelled.\n\n\nThe digital signature process has been cancelled by CPRS. This error usually shows after another problem has occurred.\n\n\n\n\n11.\n\n\nCould not digitally sign. An error has occurred: Hash generation failed.\n\n\nThe system has issues creating the hash. The hash is created using the data from the order and a specific value. This process is repeated in Pharmacy during finishing and the hash values are compared to see if anything has been changed.\n\n\n\n\n12.\n\n\nPlease verify that you are logged on to the CPRS system and that your PIV card is inserted.  There is a possible mismatch between your VistA last name and the last name of the certificate on your card.   If it matches and you are still experiencing issues, please contact your card issuer for assistance.\n \n\n\nWhen a user tries to link his/her PIV card to another VistA user logged into CPRS, a series of error messages will appear after PIN entry\n\n\n\n\n13.\n\n\nCPRS was not able to link your VistA account to a PIV card.\n\n\nWhen a user tries to link his/her PIV card to another VistA user logged into CPRS, a series of error messages will appear after PIN entry\n\n\n\n\n14.\n\n\n89802006^Smart Card Reader not found\n\n\nAs stated, the card reader was not found.

The VA's implementation of digital signatures for these medications also allows sites to limit, if needed, the outpatient controlled substance pharmacy schedules (pharmacy schedules 2-5) a prescriber has permission to prescribe. Of course, the site can also allow the provider to write for all schedules.\nTo digitally sign the controlled substances outpatient orders requires what is called two-factor authentication, which means that in addition to entering their electronic signature, the providers must use their smart card (Personal Identification Verification, or PIV cards, for example), card readers attached to workstations, Personal Identification Numbers (PIN), and digital certificates to digitally sign the orders.\nWhen the provider attempts to digitally sign the order, CPRS checks for a valid DEA registration number, VA number, or Detoxification/Maintenance number for the prescriber and to see if the provider is authorized to write medications for the specified pharmacy schedule to which the selected medication belongs. It uses a digital certificate on the card to sign the order.\nBy digitally signing the controlled substance order, the prescriber acknowledges and accepts the following as mandated by the DEA:\nBy completing the two-factor authentication protocol at this time, you are legally signing the prescription(s) and authorizing the transmission of the above information to the pharmacy for dispersing. The two-factor authentication protocol may only be completed by the practitioner whose name and DEA registration number appear above.\n \nHow Does CPRS Show a Digital Signature?\nCPRS displays order information in several places where users will be able to see that an outpatient controlled substance order was digitally signed.\nCover Sheet: If the order has been digitally signed, the detailed order display from right-clicking the order on the Cover Sheet where it now shows \"Elec Signature:\" will show \"Dig Signature:\".\n \nOrders Tab and Meds Tab: If the order has been digitally signed, the detailed order display from right-clicking the order on the Orders tab or from selecting it and choosing Details from the View menu where it now shows \"Elec Signature:\" will show \"Dig Signature:\".\n \nReports Tab: On the Daily Order Summary and Order Summary by a Date Range reports, the signature type will be Digital. On the Chart Copy Summary report, the indicator shows that the order was digitally signed.\n \nDigitally Signing Orders\nVA employees have been given a smart card, such as a Personal Identification Verification (PIV) card, to improve security. Digitally signing orders for controlled substances is one area where providers will use their smart cards.\nA Personal Identification Number (PIN) controls access to the smart card. When a user needs to digitally sign an order, the user must be at a workstation with a card reader and must insert the smart card and enter the card's current PIN.\nTo sign controlled substance orders, digitally sign the order by\n·      Proceeding with the normal electronic signature process.\n·      Selecting the controlled substance orders that you want to sign. You must select each order individually.\n·      Inserting your smart or PIV card into the card reader.\n·      When prompted, entering your PIN and clicking OK or pressing <Enter>.\n \nRelated

A print button has been added to the Preview Templates dialog so that you may either view the template on the screen or send it to a printer.\nYou can go to the following areas of this overview:\n· Personal and Shared Templates talks about the difference between shared and personal templates.\n· Types of Templates discusses templates, group templates, and folders.\n· Arranging Topics for Ease of Use talks very briefly about grouping templates.\n· Creating and Modifying Shared and Personal Templates explains uses and features of Template Editor.\n· Using Templates to Create Documents gives a brief look at how to add template text and objects to documents.\n· Template Fields explains how to add text fields to templates.\n \nPersonal and Shared Templates\nYou can create and use your own templates or you can use shared templates created by your Clinical Coordinator. The icon legend shows you the various icons and what they represent.\n·      Personal templates. Authorized users can create personal templates. You can copy and paste text into a template, type in new content, add Template Fields, or copy a shared template into your personal templates folder. A shared template that you simply copy into your personal templates folder without changing continues to be updated whenever the original template is changed or modified in the Shared Templates folder. Once you personalize or change the copy of the shared template in your personal templates folder, the icon used to represent it changes and it become a personal template. From that moment on, the personal template is not related to the shared template and is not updated with the original. Personal template and folder icons have a folded upper right corner. In the tree view, personal template and folder icons have a folded corner.\n \n·      Shared# templates. Only members of the Clinical Coordinator ASU class can create shared templates. Shared templates are available to all users. Coordinators can copy and paste text into a template, type in new content, add Template Fields, or copy a personal template and modify it as needed. In the tree view, shared template and folder icons do not have a folded corner.\n \n \nTypes of Templates\nWhen you create templates, you can go directly into the template editor, type in text, and add TIU objects and Template Fields, or if you are in a document and type in something you will use repeatedly, you simply select that text, right-click, select Create New Template, and the editor comes up with the selected text in the editing area.\nYou can create individual templates, group templates, dialog templates, folders, or link templates to Reminder dialogs.\n·      Templates contain text, TIU objects,and Template Fields that you can place in a document.\n·      Group templates contain text and TIU objects and can also contain other templates. If you place a group template in a document, all text and objects in the group template and all the templates it contains (unless they are excluded from the group template) will be placed in the document. You can also expand the view of the group template and place the individual templates it contains in a document one at a time.\n·      Dialog templates are like group templates in that they contain other templates. You can place a number of other templates under a dialog template. Then, when you drag the dialog template in your document, a dialog appears that has a check box for each template under the Dialog template. The person writing the document can check the items they want and click OK to place them in the note.\n·      Folders are like folders or directories in a file system. They are used to group and organize templates. It is there to hold templates and help in navigating the template tree view. For example, you might create a folder called \"radiology\" for templates, group templates, and other folders relating to radiology.\n·      Reminder Dialogs can have templates linked to them. This allows templates to place orders, enter PCE information, and enter vitals and mental health data. Refer to Creating Reminder Dialogs for the procedure.\n \nArranging Templates for Ease of Use\nYou can use file cabinets and folders to group similar templates together to make them easier to find and use. For example, you may want to place all of the pulmonary templates together rather than listing the templates in alphabetical order.\nUsing Templates to Create Documents\nOnce you or your clinical coordinator has created templates, adding them to a document is easy. When you create a new note, a Templates drawer appears. When you click the drawer, it opens to show you the templates that are available.\nGroup templates, dialogs, and folders may have a plus next to them. Click the plus to expand the tree view and see the templates they contain. Click a minus sign to collapse the tree view, hiding the templates under that item.\nWhen you find the template you want to place in a document, you can drag-and-drop it into the document, double-click it, or right-click and choose Insert Template. The text and objects will appear where the cursor was a few seconds later.\n \nBack to the top\n \nRelated topics\nCreating Personal Document Templates\nCreating Shared Document Templates\nGenerating a Template from a TIU Object or Note Title\nEditing Document Templates\nPreviewing a Template\nCopying Document Templates\nSearching for Document Templates\nDeleting Document Templates\n\n\n\n","Path::contents/Discontinuing_Orders.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Discontinuing_Orders.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Viewing_Medications.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Discontinuing_Orders.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Viewing_Medications.htm"},{"origLink":"Sorting_the_Medications_View.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Discontinuing_Orders.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Sorting_the_Medications_View.htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Inpatient_Medications.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Discontinuing_Orders.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Inpatient_Medications.htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Inpatient_Medications_Complex_Dose_.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Discontinuing_Orders.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Inpatient_Medications_Complex_Dose_.htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Outpatient_Medications_(Simple_Dose).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Discontinuing_Orders.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Medications_(Simple_Dose).htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Outpatient_Medications_(Complex_Dose).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Discontinuing_Orders.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Outpatient_Medications_(Complex_Dose).htm"},{"origLink":"Changing_Medication_Orders.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Discontinuing_Orders.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Changing_Medication_Orders.htm"},{"origLink":"Hold_Medication_Order.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Discontinuing_Orders.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Hold_Medication_Order.htm"},{"origLink":"Renew_Medication.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Discontinuing_Orders.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Renew_Medication.htm"},{"origLink":"Other_Medication_Actions.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Discontinuing_Orders.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Other_Medication_Actions.htm"},{"origLink":"Refilling_a_Medication.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Discontinuing_Orders.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Refilling_a_Medication.htm"}],"Path::contents/Discontinuing_Orders.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Discontinuing_Orders.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Discontinuing_Orders.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Discontinuing_Orders.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Discontinuing_Orders.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Discontinuing_Orders.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Discontinuing_Orders.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Discontinuing_Orders.htm::Title":"Discontinuing Orders","Path::contents/Discontinuing_Orders.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Discontinuing Orders,Medications,Medications:discontinuing orders","Path::contents/Discontinuing_Orders.htm::InnerText":"\nDiscontinuing Orders\nWhen an order is discontinued, the order's Stop Date/Time is changed to the date/time the action is taken.

Electronic signatures, which have been available for some time, require an electronic signature code that can be created at your site. Digital signatures in CPRS are now required to comply with new Drug Enforcement Agency's (DEA) regulations for identifying a prescriber that orders outpatient controlled substances.\nThere are three different levels of keys that influence what can be done with orders, including what dialog CPRS brings up when signing orders. Although actual practice at each site may vary, the three levels are usually referred to in these ways:\n·      OREMAS is the clerk key\n·      ORELSE is the nurse key\n·      ORES is the provider key\n \nIn CPRS, users who hold the ORES key have additional privileges and are sometimes required to enter more information than those who hold the other two keys. ORES key holders (usually an ordering provider) must enter information regarding service connection, environmental conditions or specific treatment factors, such as ionizing radiation, Agent Orange, etc.\nThis section describes the differences between electronic and digital signatures, gives an overview of service connection and treatment factors, and then gives the steps for the various ways users will sign orders. For example, users can sign orders several different ways:\n·      Review / Sign Changes... enables users to sign all orders from the current ordering session. Using this method, the user could write a number of orders and create documents and then sign all items at the same time.\n·      Sign selected... enables users to highlight one or more orders and then sign them. When the dialog displays, only the selected orders or documents will display for signature.\n·      Select New Patient brings up the signature dialog that includes all unsigned orders for the current patient before opening another patient record.

CPRS requires this information before you can place orders, write notes, add to the problem list, and so on.\nThe parameter, ORWPCE ANYTIME ENCOUNTERS, can be set to allow encounters to be entered on the Notes tab when no note is being entered. This will allow encounter entry (at the time of the visit) for dictated notes. This parameter can be set at the User, Service, Division, and System levels. Note that this will edit the encounter associated with the current location and time, which is not necessarily the encounter associated with the currently displayed note.\nTo receive workload credit, you must enter the encounter form data, including the following information, for each encounter:\n·      Service connection\n·      Provider name\n·      Location\n·      Date\n·      Diagnosis\n·      Procedure\n·      Visit Information\n \nCPRS shows the encounter provider and location for the visit on the Visit Encounter box, identified in the graphic by the pointer. You can access this box from any chart tab.\nIf a provider or location has not been assigned, CPRS will prompt you for this information when you try to enter progress notes, create orders, and perform other tasks.\nEncounter Form Data\nTo get workload credit and gather information, enter encounter form data whenever you create a progress note, complete a consult, or write a discharge summary. When you create one of these documents, an Encounter button appears. Select this button to bring up the Encounter Form. (Otherwise, you will be prompted for encounter information when you try to sign the note or exit the current patient's chart.\nThe Encounter Form has the following eight tabs:\n·      Visit Type\n·      Diagnoses\n·      Procedures\n·      Vitals\n·      Immunizations\n·      Skin Tests\n·      Patient Education\n·      Health Factors\n·      Exams\n·      Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) (The GAF tab is available only if specific Mental Health patches are installed and if the location is a mental health clinic.)\n \nYour site defines forms from the Automated Information Collection System (AICS) application to be used with the Encounter Form. Once your site has defined the necessary forms and associated them with the Encounter Form, each tab has a number of general categories on the left. When you click a general category, the corresponding items appear in the list box on the right.\nFor example, the Visit Type tab might have New Patient, Established Patient, and so on listed in the left list box. The list box on the right would then have check boxes for the different types of patient appointments, such as Brief Exam, Limited Exam, Intermediate Exam, Extended Exam, and Comprehensive exam.\nEven if you have not defined the form, you can click the Other button to get a list of choices that are active on your system.\nWhen the forms are defined and associated with the Encounter Form, you can use the Encounter Form just as you would a paper form: just click the appropriate tab, category, and check boxes to mark items or click Other and select the appropriate choice. On the Visit Type tab, a provider can indicate if the encounter is related to the various exemption categories, such as Service Connected, Combat Veteran, Agent Orange exposure, Ionizing Radiation exposure, Southwest Asia Conditions, Shipboard Hazard and Defense, Military Sexual Trauma, and Head and/or Neck Cancer. If these forms have not yet been defined, ask your Clinical Coordinator for assistance.\n \nRelated Topics\nEntering Encounter Form Data\nEntering Current Activities Encounter\n\n\n","Path::contents/Editing_Document_Templates.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Editing_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Template_Fields.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Editing_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Template_Fields.htm"},{"origLink":"Template_Name_Requirements.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Editing_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Template_Name_Requirements.htm"},{"origLink":"Document_Templates_(overview).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Editing_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Document_Templates_(overview).htm"},{"origLink":"Creating_Personal_Document_Templates.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Editing_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Creating_Personal_Document_Templates.htm"},{"origLink":"Creating_Shared_Document_Templates.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Editing_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Creating_Shared_Document_Templates.htm"},{"origLink":"Generating_a_Template_from_a_TIU_Object_or_Note_Title.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Editing_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Generating_a_Template_from_a_TIU_Object_or_Note_Title.htm"},{"origLink":"Copying_Document_Templates.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Editing_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Copying_Document_Templates.htm"},{"origLink":"Searching_for_Document_Templates.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Editing_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Searching_for_Document_Templates.htm"},{"origLink":"Deleting_Document_Templates.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Editing_Document_Templates.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Deleting_Document_Templates.htm"}],"Path::contents/Editing_Document_Templates.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Editing_Document_Templates.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Editing_Document_Templates.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Editing_Document_Templates.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Editing_Document_Templates.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Editing_Document_Templates.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Editing_Document_Templates.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Editing_Document_Templates.htm::Title":"Editing Document Templates","Path::contents/Editing_Document_Templates.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Edit,Edit:templates,Spell checking,Template,Template:changing type of,Template:editing,Template:inserting TIU objects,Template:name requirements,Template:spell checking","Path::contents/Editing_Document_Templates.htm::InnerText":"\n\nEditing Document Templates\nYou can change your personal templates and members of the Clinical Coordinator ASU class can change shared templates at any time.\nTo edit a document template, use these steps:\n1.     Select the Notes, Consults, or D/C Summ tab.\n2.     Select Options | Edit Templates (Option | Edit Shard Templates to edit shared)\n-or-\nIf the Templates drawer (Notes tab) is open, right-click in the drawer, and select Edit Templates.\n \n3.     Find the template you want to edit.\na.    Click the plus sign next to an item to see the objects under it.\nb.    Select the template you want to edit.\n \n4.     Make any desired changes, such as the following, for example:\no      Type in more text.\no      Add Template Fields\no      Change the template name\no      Move the template to a different location.\no      Make the template inactive if you don't want it seen in the template drawer.\no      If part of a group template, exclude it to make it not copy into a document when the group icon is dragged-and-dropped or double-clicked.

An allergic reaction occurs because the patient is sensitive to a causative agent, regardless of the amount the patient is exposed to. A pharmacologic (non-allergic) reaction occurs when the patient is sensitive to an agent under certain conditions, such as exposure to a large amount. Unknown is provided if you are not sure what Nature of Reaction (mechanism) to enter.\nNote:       Allergies are a subset of adverse reactions. All allergies are adverse reactions, but not all adverse reactions are allergies.\n \n11.   If you are entering an observed allergy, use the Reaction Date/Time and Severity boxes to select a reaction date, time, and severity. (The Severity box is not visible for historical allergies. If the Severity box is visible, CPRS displays a ? button at its side. If you select this button, CPRS displays text explaining severity selections.)\n12.   Using the Signs/Symptoms box, select one or more signs or symptoms. The signs and symptoms you select appear in the Selected Symptoms pane.\nNote:      Signs and symptoms must be selected from the list. Users cannot enter free-text entries.\n \n13.   To associate a date and time with a symptom (optional), click to select the symptom in the Selected Symptoms pane.\n14.   Select the Date/Time button located below the Selected Symptoms pane. CPRS displays the Select Date/Time dialog, from which you can select the date and time that the symptom first appeared.\nNote:      If you mistakenly enter a sign or symptom but have not yet accepted it by selecting OK, select the symptom in the Selected Symptoms pane and select the Remove button located beneath the pane.\n \n15.   Type comments for the allergy in the Comments text box.\n16.   If you have marked the allergy or adverse reaction on the patient's identification (ID) band (or if you know that someone else has), select the ID Band Marked check box.\nNote:      CPRS activates the ID Band Marked check box only for inpatients and then only if your site's IRM staff has set a parameter indicating that your site wants to track this information. Depending on whether your IRM staff has set related parameters, if you do not select activated ID Band Marked check box, the system may send a bulletin notifying a mail group that the patient's allergy or adverse reaction is not marked on his or her ID band.\n17.   Select OK.\nCPRS displays the newly entered causative agent in the Allergies/Adverse Reactions pane. If you click on the causative agent, CPRS displays all of the information you just entered about the associated allergy or adverse reaction. CPRS also displays the letter A (for allergies) on the Postings button and the word Allergies in the Postings pane. If you click the word Allergies in the Postings pane, CPRS displays selected information about all of the patient's active allergies and adverse reactions, including the allergy or adverse reaction you just entered.\n \nMethod Two\nTake the following steps to enter a new allergy using the second of the two methods mentioned above:\n1.     Select a causative agent listed in the Allergies/Adverse Reactions pane. CPRS displays a dialog that includes details about the allergy or adverse reaction associated with the selected causative agent. The dialog also includes four buttons.\n2.     Select the Add New button.\nCPRS displays the Allergy Reactant Lookup dialog.\n \n3.     Follow steps 4 through 17 of the instructions for entering allergies using the first method. CPRS displays the newly entered causative agent in the Allergies/Adverse Reactions pane. If you click on the causative agent, CPRS displays all of the information you just entered about the associated allergy or adverse reaction. CPRS also displays the letter A (for allergies) on the Postings button and the word Allergies in the Postings pane.

CPRS will prompt for CIDC information for the following types of orders:\n·      Laboratory (outpatient only)\n·      Outpatient Pharmacy (outpatient only)\n·      Radiology (inpatient and outpatient)\n·      Prosthetic Consults (inpatient and outpatient)\n \nClinicians can enter up to four diagnoses for each order and designate one of these as the primary diagnosis.\nClinicians should use their best judgment to enter diagnoses that might be symptomatic when ordering tests rather than the resulting diagnosis after a test. They are not entering the suspected diagnosis, but the actual reason the patient was sent for the lab test or radiology procedure. For example, if a clinician sees a patient with a high fever and difficulty breathing, the clinician may believe that the patient has pneumonia, but if the clinician orders tests to verify the pneumonia, the clinician would enter a diagnosis of \"fever\", not \"pneumonia\".\n \nWhen Will Providers See CIDC Changes?\nFor clinicians to use the new features to enter at least one diagnosis for these orders, the following four conditions must be met:\n·      The site must install the appropriate patches.\n·      The clinician must have the Provider key and the ORES key (CIDC entry required) or the ORELSE key (CIDC entry optional).\n·      The site must enable the master Clinical Indicators Data Capture switch.\n·      The individual Clinical Indicators Data Capture switch enabled for the clinician.\n \nInstructions for enabling Clinical Indicators Data Capture at both the site and individual level are available in the CPRS Technical Manual: GUI Version.\nWhere Will Users See the Changes?\nWhen the site enables CIDC at the site level and for individual clinicians, the clinicians who hold the Provider key will see the following changes in CPRS:\n·      The Review / Sign Changes and Sign Selected dialogs will now have areas where diagnoses will be captured for the specified orders. These diagnoses and treatment factors will then be available on the Encounter form if the clinician signs the orders first.\n·      The Encounter Form's Diagnosis tab will enable clinicians to enter diagnoses for the encounter. These diagnoses will then be available on the orders tab if the clinician does the encounter form first.\n·      Order detailed displays will now display the associated treatment factors and diagnoses.\n·      A new Assign Diagnosis to Order(s) dialog has been added for clinicians to use in designating one or more diagnoses for each of the types listed above.\n·      A new Personal Diagnosis List dialog to create a personal diagnosis list that providers can use as a source on the new Assign Diagnosis to Order(s) dialog.\n \nWhat Features in CPRS Make Entering Diagnoses Easier?\nCPRS has the following features to help clinicians assign diagnoses to orders:\n·      Automatically copying the diagnoses, service-connection, and treatment factors when a user copies, renews, or changes an order.\n·      Selecting a group of orders to assign diagnoses at the same time. Clinicians can select a group of orders using the Windows conventions of Shift + Click to highlight a contiguous group of orders and Crtl + Click to add individual orders to the group. All of the orders can then be assigned the same primary and secondary diagnoses.\n·      Copying and pasting diagnoses from one order to others. Clinicians who hold the Provider key can highlight an order on the signature dialogs, copy the diagnosis, highlight one or more additional orders, and paste the same diagnosis for them.\n·      Providing multiple sources for diagnoses. CPRS displays multiple diagnoses sources for clinicians to locate the appropriate diagnoses:\no      Orders written today if on the Encounter form\no      Encounter diagnoses from today if writing orders\no      Personal Diagnosis List\no      National Encounter forms if defined\no      Problem List entries\no      The Lexicon search.\n \n·      Automatically populating treatment factors for diagnoses selected from the Problem List. One possible source for diagnoses is the patient's Problem List entries. If a problem has service connection and treatment factor information associated with it on the Problem List and the user selects that Problem List entry as the diagnosis, CPRS automatically places checks in the appropriate check boxes on the signature forms. The provider can, of course, edit the checks.\n·      Creating a personal diagnosis list. Developers provided personal diagnosis list that is specific to each clinician. Each clinician can quickly add diagnoses that he or she frequently uses so that they can be assigned quickly.\n \nRelated topics\nReview / Sign Changes Dialog\nSign Selected Orders Command\n\n\n","Path::contents/Entering_No_Known_Allergies.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Entering_No_Known_Allergies.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Entering_Allergies.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Entering_No_Known_Allergies.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Entering_Allergies.htm"},{"origLink":"Viewing_Allergies_Adverse_Reactions.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Entering_No_Known_Allergies.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Viewing_Allergies_Adverse_Reactions.htm"}],"Path::contents/Entering_No_Known_Allergies.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Entering_No_Known_Allergies.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Entering_No_Known_Allergies.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Entering_No_Known_Allergies.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Entering_No_Known_Allergies.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Entering_No_Known_Allergies.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Entering_No_Known_Allergies.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Entering_No_Known_Allergies.htm::Title":"Entering No Known Allergies","Path::contents/Entering_No_Known_Allergies.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Allergies,Allergies:entering \"no known allergies\"","Path::contents/Entering_No_Known_Allergies.htm::InnerText":"\nEntering a No Known Allergies Assessment\nYou can enter no-known-allergies (NKA) assessments for patients who have no active allergies by taking the following steps:\n1.     On the Cover Sheet, right-click within the Allergies/Adverse Reactions pane.\n2.     From this menu, select Mark patient as having No Known Allergies (NKA).\nCPRS displays the No Known Allergies dialog.\nNote:      CPRS activates The Mark patient as having No Known Allergies (NKA) menu selection only for patients who have no active allergies.

consult has been completed, you can only change encounter information directly through PCE software in the VistA roll and scroll.\n \nTo enter or change encounter form data, follow these steps:\n1.    Select the appropriate tab: Notes, Consults, or D/C Summ.\n2.     Select New Note, New Summary or select Action | Consult Results...or locate the appropriate unsigned document in the treeview. For the consult or discharge summary, skip to step 4.\n3.     Type in a title for the note or summary or select one from the list and press <Enter>.\n4.     On the Notes tab, select the Encounter button, Action | Encounter, or Edit Encounter Information from the right-click pop-up menu.

You can also highlight a provider’s name and make that provider the primary provider for the encounter.\n \nB.)       Diagnosis: Enter the diagnoses for this encounter using either Diagnosis Section categories and accompanying diagnoses or use the Other Diagnosis… button to search for a diagnosis. In the Diagnosis Section pane, CPRS displays the sources for prepopulated diagnoses, such as the Problem List Items and any encounter forms your site has set up for the location or clinic. With the Other Diagnosis… button, the provider types all or part of a term and searches for diagnoses containing the specified text. The provider may need to revise the search with a broader or narrower term to locate the correct diagnosis.\n1.       For the Diagnosis Section: To use the Problem List Items or other Encounter forms available, select the Diagnosis tab if it is not already selected.\n2.       Select the appropriate source if one is available in the list, such as Problem List Items or an Encounter form that your site has made available. When you select the source, the associated diagnoses display in the pane to the right, which will now have the name of the source above the pane.\n3.       Use the check boxes to select the appropriate items from the list. As you select a problem or diagnosis, CPRS will check if the item has an active code, a specific code, and is in the right coding system.\n \n\n \nThis screen shows a diagnosis on the Encounter form with an inactive code. If the provider selects a diagnosis, CPRS requires the diagnosis to have an appropriate active code. With ICD-10, all items from the Problem List are now displayed on the Diagnosis tab. Providers could see both active and inactive ICD-9 codes and SNOMED-CT codes. All displayed codes can be selected, but CPRS may require the provider to locate an active code or one from a different coding system. For example, if a user selects a SNOMED or ICD-9 code for an encounter after the ICD-10 activation date, CPRS will prompt the provider to locate an appropriate ICD-10 code.\n \n\nIf a user selects a diagnosis or procedure with an inactive code, the above dialog will display telling the user that the code is inactive and that the user should change it. This will change after the ICD-10 activation date because the problem will need to be updated from the Diagnosis tab, not the Problem List tab\n \n4.     If the item selected can be used to check out the encounter, it will display under the Selected Diagnoses section. Proceed to step 7. If another dialog displays proceed to step 5. If a provider tries to enter a diagnosis or procedure that has an inactive (shown with a hash or # symbol either because the code itself has become inactive or because it is from a superseded coding system) or unspecified code (799.9 in ICD-9 or R69 in ICD-10) associated with it, CPRS does not accept that selection and displays the search dialog for the provider to locate an appropriate diagnosis.\n\n5.     Enter a term or some text to search and select the Search button. Matching terms will be displayed under the Term pane. Before the activation date, the dialog displays possible ICD-9 codes to check out the encounter. The description, code, and coding system will display. After ICD-10 activation, the dialog will display ICD-10 codes, with the description, code, and coding system.\n6.     Highlight the appropriate term and select OK.  After ICD-10 activation, providers may see terms displayed with a tree view containing broader terms with a plus sign or arrow that they will need to expand to find a more specific term.\n7.    (Conditional) After ICD-10 activation, if the provider updates the ICD code, it may trigger a need to update the problem on the Problem List with a new SNOMED code. If it does, a dialog will display and the provider will need to search for and select a SNOMED term for the Problem list. After the term is selected, the problem list will be updated, but the provider may need to refresh to see the change on the Problems tab.\n\nNote:     If the provider cancels the process when selecting a SNOMED term, the entire process is canceled, including the ICD code selection that was previously performed.\n8.     After CPRS has a valid code, the code will display in the pane below with its name, coding system, and code. The first diagnosis you choose will be the primary diagnosis by default.\n9.      If you need to change a different diagnosis in the list to be the primary diagnosis, highlight the item and select the Primary button.\n10.    If a diagnosis has been entered mistakenly, highlight the diagnosis and select Remove.\n11.    If you need to add a comment, type it into the Comment field.\n-OR-\n \n1.       To use the Other Diagnosis… button to select a diagnosis: Select the Other Diagnosis… button. CPRS now displays the Lookup Diagnosis dialog.\n2.      In the Search for Diagnosis field, type a term or some text that refers to the diagnosis (such as “diabet” for diabetes) and select Search. The Lexicon is then searched and a list of matching terms is displayed. Plus signs next to terms indicate that there are terms underneath it that are more specific or synonymous. When the user highlights a term, the term, coding system and code are displayed below the list of terms.\n\nThe Lookup Diagnosis dialog enables users to search for the appropriate term to describe the patient’s condition. As shown above, after ICD-10 activation, the results will be in a tree view and providers may need to expand the category to locate a specific term. If too many terms are found, CPRS will prompt the user to be more specific.\n \n3.    If appropriate terms are not found, refine your search terms and select Search again.\n4.     Highlight the appropriate diagnosis. If the display shows a tree view, note that you must select a specific term and not an item with a plus sign in front of it. When a term is highlighted, the diagnosis is then displayed below the Term pane with its term, code, and coding system. Verify that this is the diagnosis you want. If not, locate the best term. If it is, select OK. The diagnosis will then be added to the pane below the Other Diagnosis… button, showing the name of the term, the coding system, and the code.\n \n \n\n\nThis screen shows a diagnosis on the Encounter form with an inactive code. If the user selects a diagnosis, CPRS requires the user to select an appropriate active code. All items from the Problem List are now displayed on the Diagnosis tab. Providers could see both active and inactive ICD-9 codes and SNOMED-CT codes. All displayed codes can be selected, but CPRS may require the provider to locate an active code or one from a different coding system. For example, if a user selects a SNOMED or ICD-9 code for an encounter after the ICD-10 activation date, CPRS will prompt the provider to locate an appropriate ICD-10 code.\n \n\nIf a user selects a diagnosis or procedure with an inactive code, the above dialog will display telling the user that the code is inactive and that the user should change it. This will change after the ICD-10 activation date because the problem will need to be updated from the Diagnosis tab, not the Problem List tab.\n \n5.    (OPTIONAL) To add the diagnosis to the Problem List, highlight the diagnosis (to add all use the Select All button), select the Add to Problem List check box. Then, in the dialog that displays, type a few characters of the SNOMED term and select Search, highlight the appropriate entry and select OK.\n6.     You may repeat steps 1-5 to add other diagnoses.\n7.      The first diagnosis you select will be the primary diagnosis unless you designate another as primary. To designate another diagnosis as primary, highlight the appropriate diagnosis and select the Primary button.\n8.     If you add a diagnosis by mistake, highlight it and select Remove.\n9.     To add a comment, type it in the Comment field.\n \nC.)  Procedures: Enter procedures performed using either the pre-populated Procedures Section or the Other Procedures… button.\n1.       For the Procedures Section, select a source if one is available in the list.

To move a reminder up or down the list, select the reminder and click either the up or down arrow.\no     select the \"Alphabetical\" option (at the bottom of the dialog) to display the reminders in alphabetical order.\n \nClinical Reminders and Reminder Categories Displayed on Cover Sheet\nThis advanced dialog displays reminders in a way that allows the user to better manage the reminders that are displayed on the Cover Sheet. The dialog consists mainly of three large list fields. The \"Cover Sheet Reminders (Cumulative List)\" field displays selected information on the reminders that will be displayed on the Cover Sheet. The \"Available Reminders & Categories\" field lists all available reminders and serves as a selection list. The \"User Level Reminders\" field displays the reminders that you have added to or removed from the cumulative list.\nYou may sort the Reminders in the \"Cover Sheet Reminders (Cumulative List)\" field by clicking on any of the column headers. Click on the Seq (Sequence) column header to view the Reminders in the order in which they will be displayed on your Cover Sheet.\nAn icon legend is displayed to the right of the \"Cover Sheet Reminders (Cumulative List)\" field. A folder icon represents a group of Reminders while a red alarm clock represents an individual Reminder. A Reminder with a plus sign in the first column has been added to the list while a Reminder with a minus sign in the first column has been removed from the list. The user cannot remove reminders with a padlock icon in the first column.\n \nCover Sheet Reminders (Cumulative List)\nThe Level column of the \"Cover Sheet Reminders (Cumulative List)\" field displays the originating authority of the Reminder, which can include System, Division, Location, User Class, and User. Reminders on this list that display a small gray padlock icon at the beginning of the line cannot be removed. These Reminders are mandatory. The Seq (Sequence) column defines the order in which the Reminders will be displayed on the Cover Sheet. If there are two or more Reminders with the same sequence number, the Reminders will be listed by level (System, Division, Service, Location, User class, User).\n \nLocation shown in Cumulative List\nSelect this drop-down box and select a location. The Reminders assigned to that location appear on the Cumulative List.\n \nAvailable Reminders & Categories\nThis field displays all of the Reminders and Categories available to the user. Notice that the reminder name is in parentheses after the print name. Categories are groups of related Reminders that can be added as a group. Individual reminders within a category can be removed from the User Level Reminders field. Highlight a Reminder or Category from the field and click the right arrow to add them to the User Level Reminders field.\n \nUser-Level Reminders\nThis field displays all of the Reminders selected by the user. To add a Reminder to your User Level Reminders, highlight the desired Reminder in the Available Reminders & Categories field and click the right arrow button. To delete a Reminder from your User Level Reminders field, highlight the Reminder in the User Level Reminders field and click the left arrow.\nYou may determine the order in which the Reminders will be displayed on the Cover Sheet by changing the Reminder's sequence number. For example, to place a Reminder at the top of the Reminders list, assign it a number less than 10. To change the order of User Level Reminders, highlight Reminders and click the up arrow or down arrow until the desired order is achieved.\nYou may remove any or all non-mandatory Reminders assigned at any level by adding the Reminder to your User Level and then clicking the Remove button.\n \nCover Sheet Reminders\nOnce you have the cumulative List, as you want it, select View Cover Sheet Reminders to view how the reminders will be displayed on your Cover Sheet for the specified locations.\nOnce you have made all of the desired changes to the Reminders that will be displayed on the Cover Sheet, select OK.\n \nOther Parameters...\nTo set the initial chart tab, Meds tab date range, or Encounter date range select Other Parameters.\n \nChart Tabs\nSelect the drop-down field and select the chart tab with which CPRS should open. select the check box if you want CPRS to remain on the last selected tab when you change patients.\nNote:      For this change to take effect, you must exit CPRS and log back in.\n \nMeds Tab Date Ranges\n1.     Enter a start date by doing one of the following:\no      Typing a date (e.g. 6/21/01 or June 21, 2001).\no      Typing a date formula (e.g. t-200).\no      Pressing the  button to bring up a calendar and select a date.\n \n2.     Enter a stop date by doing one of the following:\no      Typing a date (e.g. 6/21/01 or June 21, 2001).\no      Typing a date formula (e.g. t-200).\no      Pressing the  button to bring up a calendar and select a date.\n \n3.     When you have entered the dates, go to another option on this dialog or select OK.\n \nEncounter Appointments Date Range\nThis option enables users to set the date range for Encounter appointments that CPRS displays on the Cover Sheet and the Encounter form. The two values are based on today;s date and represent how many days in the past and how many days in the future the user may set for CPRS to display appointments.\nTo set these values, use the following steps:\n1.     In the Start Date field, type or use the arrows to select a number of days in the past CPRS should display appointments.\n2.     In the Stop Date field, type or use the arrows to select a number of days in the future CPRS should display appointments.\nNote:      Your site can set a parameter to give you a warning if you select an appointment too far in the future. CPRS will display a warning to let you know that you may be going against local policy. This message is just a warning and you may proceed.\n \n3.     When you have entered the dates, go to another option on this dialog or select OK.\n \nRelated Topics\nPersonal Preferences (Tools | Options)\nNotifications Tab (Tools | Options)\nOrder Checks Tab (Tools | Options)\nLists/Teams Tab (Tools | Options)\nNotes Tab (Tools | Options)\nReports Tab (Tools | Options)\nGraphs Tab (Tools | Options)\n\n\n","Path::contents/Graphing__Exporting_Data.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Graphing__Exporting_Data.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Graphing_Overview.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Graphing__Exporting_Data.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Graphing_Overview.htm"},{"origLink":"Graphing_Starting_CPRS_Graphing.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Graphing__Exporting_Data.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Graphing_Starting_CPRS_Graphing.htm"},{"origLink":"Graphing_Configuring_Settings.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Graphing__Exporting_Data.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Graphing_Configuring_Settings.htm"},{"origLink":"Graphing_Starting_CPRS_Graphing.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Graphing__Exporting_Data.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Graphing_Starting_CPRS_Graphing.htm"},{"origLink":"Graphing_Configuring_Settings.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Graphing__Exporting_Data.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Graphing_Configuring_Settings.htm"},{"origLink":"Graphing_Predefined_Views.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Graphing__Exporting_Data.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Graphing_Predefined_Views.htm"},{"origLink":"Graphing_Graphing_Items_from_the_Main_Window.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Graphing__Exporting_Data.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Graphing_Graphing_Items_from_the_Main_Window.htm"},{"origLink":"Graphing_Graphing_Items_from_the_Select_Items_and_Define_Views_Dialog_Box.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Graphing__Exporting_Data.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Graphing_Graphing_Items_from_the_Select_Items_and_Define_Views_Dialog_Box.htm"},{"origLink":"Graphing_Adjusting_the_Display.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Graphing__Exporting_Data.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Graphing_Adjusting_the_Display.htm"},{"origLink":"Graphing_Displayed_Details_for_Graphed_Items.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Graphing__Exporting_Data.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Graphing_Displayed_Details_for_Graphed_Items.htm"},{"origLink":"Graphing_Using_the_Zoom_Feature.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Graphing__Exporting_Data.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Graphing_Using_the_Zoom_Feature.htm"},{"origLink":"Graphing_Copy_and_Paste_or_Print_Graphs.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Graphing__Exporting_Data.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Graphing_Copy_and_Paste_or_Print_Graphs.htm"}],"Path::contents/Graphing__Exporting_Data.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Graphing__Exporting_Data.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Graphing__Exporting_Data.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Graphing__Exporting_Data.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Graphing__Exporting_Data.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Graphing__Exporting_Data.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Graphing__Exporting_Data.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Graphing__Exporting_Data.htm::Title":"Graphing: Exporting Data","Path::contents/Graphing__Exporting_Data.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Graphing:exporting data","Path::contents/Graphing__Exporting_Data.htm::InnerText":"\nGraphing: Exporting Data\nGraph patient data can also be exported to a spreadsheet.

A consult or consultation is a referral of a patient by the primary care physician to another hospital service/specialty, to obtain a medical opinion based on patient evaluation and completion of any procedures, modalities, or treatments the consulting specialist deems necessary to render a medical opinion.\n \nCPRS\nComputerized Patient Record System, the DHCP package (in both GUI and character-based formats) that provides access to most components of the patient chart.\n \nCWAD\nCrises, Warnings, Allergies, and (Advanced) Directives. Also called \"postings\", these notes provide important information about a patient, such as a \"Do Not Resuscitate\" order or known allergies. In the CPRS GUI, the CWAD button is on the upper right. If a patient has only Warnings, a \"W\" will appear on the button. Each letter will appear only if a note exists in that category.\n \nD/C Summaries\nSee Discharge Summary.\n \nDischarge Summary\nA component or package of CPRS (it can function as part of CPRS or independently as a standalone package or as part of TIU). A Discharge Summary is a summary of a patient's record of care, required at time of discharge.\n \nEncounter\nA visit (or telephone call) with a health care provider. All outpatient visits require encounter data, including service connection, a provider name, a procedure, and a diagnosis, to receive workload credit. Health care workers will be prompted for encounter information when they enter clinically relevant information. Encounter information also helps track who gave what orders for patient care.\n \nGUI\nGraphical User Interface, the Windows-like screen with pull-down menus, icons, pointer device, etc.\n \nImaging\nImaging is the name of the umbrella package that includes Radiology and Nuclear Medicine. Tests and procedures for these packages can be ordered, results can be viewed, and reports can be generated through CPRS.\n \nOE/RR\nOrder Entry/Results Reporting, a VISTA program that evolved into the more comprehensive CPRS.\n \nPostings\nMessages about a patient, similar to CWAD, but more extensive.\n \nProgress Notes\nA progress note is a health provider's recorded observations about a patient at the time of an encounter (inpatient or outpatient). Progress Notes can function as part of CPRS and also as part of TIU to let users enter, edit, sign, review, and print online progress notes through either program.

(See the \"Creating Predefined Views\"  section for more information about creating views.)\nThe Item list contains only items that are available for the patient and date range you have selected. If no items appear on this list, try adjusting your data-source settings.

Users can also save public views as a personal view and then alter it to suit their personal preferences.\n \nTo display view definition, use these steps:\n1.     Highlight the view name.\n2.     Select View Definition from the pop-up menu.\nThe definition with them display in a pane below View list.\n \nTake the following steps to create new views:\n1.     Access the Define Views or Select Items and Define Views dialog box using one of the these four methods.\n2.     Select All Items in the Select Items using area located at the top of the dialog.\n3.     Select a data source from the Source list.\nCPRS displays in the Items list all items associated with this source.\n \n4.     If you know you want to include all items, double-click the source to add it--and its associated items--to the Items for Graphing list. You can also add all items for the source by clicking the  button.\n-or-\nDouble-click individual items you want to add to the Items for Graphing list. You can also select individual items by highlighting them and then clicking the  button.\n \nOther tips for adding items to the Items for Graphing list:\no     Select Drug Class in the Source list to make available for selection all drugs (inpatient, outpatient, non-VA, and BCMA).\no     Select Medication, Bcma; Medication, Inpatient; Medication, Outpatient; or Medication, Non-VA to display only medications for these sources. For example, if you want to select a specific outpatient medication, click Medication, Outpatient and then add the medication to the Items for Graphing list.\no     In the Source list, Anatomic Pathology and Microbiology include sub sources. When you click the primary sources (Anatomic Pathology or Microbiology), CPRS graphing displays their sub sources in its Items list. If you add to the Items for Graphing list sub sources from the Items list, you automatically add all items associated with the sub sources. To add individual items associated with sub sources, select the sub sources from the Source list.\no     CPRS moves all selected items to the Items for Graphing list. If you select duplicate items from different sources, CPRS merges the duplicate items when you add them to the Items for Graphing list.\n \n5.     (Optional) You can remove items from the Items for Graphing list by double-clicking them. You can also use the  button or the  button to remove items.\n6.     Repeat steps 2-5 until you have selected all items that you want to include in your view.\n7.     Select Save Personal to save these items in a personal view or, if you are authorized to do so, select Save Public to save the items in a view that is available to all users.\n8.     In the Save your Personal View or Save this Public View dialog box, type a name for your new view. CPRS saves view names in all capital letters and displays them using title caps. Therefore, you cannot use capitalization schemes to save different views that have the same name. You must give each view a new name unless you plan to overwrite an existing view.\n9.     Select OK.\nYour view is now available on the Source list in the Select/Define and Select Items and Define Views dialog boxes. It is also available on the View list\n \nRelated Topics\nGraphing: Editing Predefined Views\nGraphing: Renaming Predefined Views\nGraphing: Deleting Predefined Views\nGraphing Overview\nStart CPRS

Following is a brief discussion of selected items and their corresponding representations.\n \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmissions and Visits:\n\n\nCPRS graphing displays visits and admissions on the horizontal (date/time) axis as lines or bars that indicate the duration of the visits and admissions. Bars representing hospital admissions begin at the date and time of admission and end at the date and time of discharge. Visit representations begin at the appointment date and time and end at the date and time of the visit's end. Because visit durations are often short, visit representations are typically vertical lines, rather than bars. When visit durations are unavailable, CPRS graphing uses its default duration of one hour.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents:\n\n\nCPRS graphing displays as single events all items that are not laboratory tests, vitals measurements, medications (inpatient, non-VA, or outpatient), or visits. Like representations for admissions and visits, representations for single events use only the horizontal axis. CPRS graphing uses triangle-shaped representations to mark these items. (Color, shape, and height differentiate item markers.) It graphs administration times for BCMA medications as events.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedications:\n\n\nAs it does with admissions and visits, CPRS graphing displays medications as bars that indicate a period of time. In the case of outpatient medications, bars begin on the horizontal axis at the release date of the medications. End dates are based on the following calculation: medication release date + number of days supply = end date. For inpatient and non-VA medications, bars begin at medication start times and dates and end at medication stop times and dates. In the case of non-VA medications, if no stop date exists, CPRS graphing uses the current date as the stop date.\nCPRS graphing differentiates multiple medications by color and vertically offsets them to ensure the visibility of overlapping bars.\nImportant: Healthcare professionals have no reliable way to determine whether patients do or do not take their outpatient medications. Use caution when graphing relationships between outpatient medications and other items.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVitals:\n\n\nCPRS graphing displays vitals measurements as points on two axes. If more than one measurement exists for a given date and time, CPRS graphing connects measurements for like items with a line.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabs:\n\n\nCPRS graphing also displays as points on two axes laboratory tests that have results with numerical values. Lines connect like items.\nCPRS graphing displays lab tests with non-numerical results (positive and negative results, for example) as points on the horizontal axis. It does not connect like items that have non-numerical results. To keep them out of the way of numerical data, CPRS graphing displays non-numerical results above or below the numerical values and line. Values beginning with > are located at the top margin; others are graphed at the bottom margin. Free-text values display by default as do comments.

The screen reader will stop when it gets to a control, such a drop-down box or some other item. These codes will allow the users who create templates at the sites to control when the screen reader needs to stop and when it would be better for it to continue. For example, if in the template, the user needs to enter a number, but some explanatory text after the number is needed, the Screen reader Continue Code will enable the template creator to make the screen reader continue reading to give the visually impaired user all the information he or she needs. Another example would be some text that normally would not be read until a button received focus.\nThese codes enable template creators to more tightly control what is read when the screen reader is running. When it is not, they will not have the effect. Template creators will need to work with visually impaired users to ensure the templates are reading correctly.\n \nTo add a Template Field into a Template complete the following steps:\n1.     From the Notes, Consults or D/C Summ tab, select Options | Edit Templates..., Create Templates, Edit Shared Templates, or Create New Shared Template...\n2.     From the Template Editor, select the template to which you will add a Template Field.\n3.     Insert the cursor at the place in the Template Boilerplate field where you wish to insert the Template Field.\n4.     From the tool bar, select Edit | Insert Template Field or right-click in the template and select Insert Template Field.\n5.     On the Insert Template Field dialog, type the first few letters of the desired field or scroll through the list until the desired field is located and select it.\n6.     Select the field you want to insert.\n7.     Select Insert Field.\n8.     Repeat steps 5 through 7 for each additional Template field you wish to insert.\n9.     Select Done when you have added all of the desired template fields.\n10.   From the tool bar, select Edit | Preview/Print Template or right-click in the template and select Preview/Print Template.

are part of Inpatient Medications. This module uses the types of information listed below for processing orders. Click on a term to go to its definition.\n·       Type\n·       Additive\n·       Strength\n·       Solution\n·       Volume\n·       Infusion rate\n·       Med route\n·       Schedule\n·       Administration times\n·       Remarks\n·       Other print\n·       Start date\n·       Stop date\n·       Provider\n·       Nature of Order\n·      On call\n \nType\nThis describes the type of IV order to be placed. Orders identified as admixtures,chemotherapy admixtures, chemotherapy syringes (continuous) and hyperals are treated as continuous orders. Other types are assumed to be administered intermittently based on the orders schedule.\n \nAdditive\nThere can be any number of additives for an order, including zero. You can enter an additive or additive synonym. If your IRM Chief/Site Manager or Application Coordinator has defined it in the IV Additives file, you may enter a quick code for an additive. The quick code allows you to predefine certain fields, thus speeding up the order entry process.\n \nStrength\nThe strength of the additive specified to be included in the order. Strength must be entered for each additive.\n \nSolution\nThere can be any number of solutions in an order, depending on the type. It is even possible to require zero solutions when an additive is premixed with a solution. If no solutions are chosen, the computer will give you a warning message, in case it is an oversight, and give you an opportunity to add one. You may enter an IV solution or IV solution synonym.\n \nVolume\nThis is the amount of the solution to be included in the order. The total volume of the order is used along with Infusion Rate to determine projected administration times for the order.\n \nInfusion Rate\nThe infusion rate is the rate at which the IV is to be administered. This value, in conjunction with the total volume of the hyperal or the admixture type, is used to determine the time covered by one bag; hence the system can predict the bags needed during a specified time of coverage. This field is free text for piggybacks. For admixtures you must enter a number that will represent the infusion rate. You can also specify the # of bags per day that will be needed. Example: 125 = 125 ml/hr (IV system will calculate bags needed per day), 125@2 = 125 ml/hr with 2 labels per day, Titrate@1 = Titrate with 1 label per day. The format of this field is either a number only or <free text > @ <Number of labels per day > (e.g., Titrate @ 1).\n \nMed Route\nThis is the route of administration for this medication (e.g., IV, SQ). If a corresponding abbreviation is found for this route in the MEDICATION ROUTES file, this module will print that abbreviation on its reports.\n \nSchedule\nThis defines the frequency the order is to be administered. Schedules may be selected from the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) or day-of-week or admin/time schedules may be used. Inpatient Medications recognizes schedules in the following formats:\n·      QxH - Hourly schedules where x is the number of hours between administrations\n·      QxD - Daily schedules where x is the number of days between administrations\n·      QxM - Monthly schedules where x is the number of months between administrations\n \nIf a schedule is defined for the Orderable Item selected when entering a new order, that schedule is displayed as the default for the order.\n \nAdministration Times\nThis defines the time(s) of day the order is to be given. If the schedule for the order contains \"PRN\" any administration times for the order will be ignored. In new order entry, the default administration times are determined as described below:\nIf administration times are defined for the Orderable Item selected, they will be shown as the default for the order.\nIf administration times are defined in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) for the patient's ward and the order's schedule, they will be shown as the default for the order.\nIf administration times are defined for the Schedule, they will be shown as the default for the order.\n \nRemarks\nThis contains additional information about the order that is not to be included on the IV or MAR labels.\n \nOther Print\nThis data is included on the IV and MAR labels.\n \nStart Date\nThe default start date/time for the order is calculated based on the DEFAULT START DATE CALCULATION field (#.05) of the INPATIENT WARD PARAMETERS file (#59.6). This allows the site to use the next or closest administration or delivery time, or the order's login date/time as the default start date/time. For continuous IV orders the default start date/time is based on the delivery times for the IV room specified. For intermittent IV orders this default is based on the order's administration times.\n \nStop Date\nThe default stop date/time for the order is determined by the <IV TYPE> GOOD FOR HOW MANY DAYS fields in the IV ROOM file (#59.5), where <IV TYPE> is piggyback, admixture, syringe, chemotherapy, etc. If the NUMBER OF DAYS FOR IV ORDER field (#3) of the IV ADDITIVES file (#52.6) is less then it will be used instead.\n \nProvider\nThis identifies the provider who authorized the order. Only users identified as providers who are authorized to write medication orders may be selected.\n \nNature Of Order\nThis specifies how the order originated. An order can be specified as written on the chart, telephoned, or verbal. This data is stored and displayed through OE/RR.\n \nOn Call\nOnly active orders may be placed on call. Orders placed on call will continue to show under the active heading of the profile until it is taken off call. An entry is placed in the order's activity log recording the person who took the action and when it was taken.\n\n\n","Path::contents/Lab_Orders_(All).htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Lab_Orders_(All).htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"}],"Path::contents/Lab_Orders_(All).htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Lab_Orders_(All).htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Lab_Orders_(All).htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Lab_Orders_(All).htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Lab_Orders_(All).htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Lab_Orders_(All).htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Lab_Orders_(All).htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Lab_Orders_(All).htm::Title":"Lab Orders (All)","Path::contents/Lab_Orders_(All).htm::InnerText":"\nLab Status\nAs the name implies, you can use this option to check on the status of labs that have been ordered for the selected patient.

The ICD-10-CM codes will not replace diagnosis codes already entered as ICD-9-CM codes, but all new diagnosis codes in Clinical Reminders, Consults, and the encounter form, will be ICD-10-CM codes. There will be no requirement to update existing entries because the diagnosis codes will reflect the coding system that existed when the diagnosis was entered.\nDiagnosis codes on the Problem List will primarily be SNOMED-CT codes, but will show ICD-10 or ICD-9 codes also, if they apply.\n \nIdentifying Which Coding System Is Displaying\nBecause there will be the possibility of several types of codes being visible in CPRS, each code will be followed by text stating what coding system is being displayed:\n\nSNOMED-CT or Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine concept terms: Codes in the SNOMED-CT display with the Short Description (Coding system code). For example, Keratinous cyst (SCT 419603000)\nICD-9-CMor International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision Clinical Modification: The text format will be something like the following: Short Description (coding system code). For example, ILIAC (ICD-9-CM 451.81).\nICD-10-CM or International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision Clinical Modification: The text format will be something like the following: Short Description (coding system code). For example, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ICD-10-CM G12.21).\n\n \n\n\n\nICD-9-CM\n\n\nICD-10-CM\n\n\n\n\n3-5 characters in length\n\n\n3-7 characters in length\n\n\n\n\n1st character is numeric (chapters 1-17) or alphabetic (E or V for supplemental chapters)\n\n\n1St character is alphabetic; 2nd character is numeric\n\n\n\n\n2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th characters are numeric\n\n\nCharacters 3-7 are alphabetic or numeric (alphabetic characters are not case sensitive)\n\n\n\n\nDecimal after first three characters\n\n\nDecimal after 3rd character\n\n\n\n \nUsers will see changes in the areas where ICD-9-CM codes were used previously:\n\nCover Sheet– Under the Active Problems pane, users will see problems with SNOMED and ICD-9-CM codes. ICD-10-CM codes do not appear on the Problem List, except in the detailed view of a problem.\nProblem List– On the Problem List tab’s list and detailed views\nOn the Encounter form’s Diagnosis tab – On the Diagnosis tab of the Encounter form, users now select diagnosis codes from the ICD-10-CM code set.\nConsults tab– When selecting a provisional diagnosis, the user will use ICD-10-CM.\nReminder dialogs– When dialog are constructed to include the addition of codes, those codes will now use ICD-10-CM codes.\n\n \n \nIdentifying Inactive Codes in CPRS\nCode set versioning (CSV) modifies VistA to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA) stipulations that diagnostic and procedure codes used for billing purposes must be the codes that were applicable at the time the service was provided. Because the codes change, CPRS currently checks ICD and CPT code validity as of a specified date when codes are entered, when a new code set is implemented, and whenever Clinical Application Coordinators (CACs) or IRM personnel choose to run the option.\nCPRS GUI users will see indicators for inactive codes on the Cover Sheet, Problems tab, Encounter form, and in Clinical Reminders (although the Clinical Reminders changes may be less apparent).\nIn these GUI locations, any diagnosis or procedure codes that are inactive or will become inactive by a specified date because a new code set has been installed display with the \"#\" symbol in front of them as shown in the following examples.\nCover Sheet Displays\nOn the Cover Sheet, the active problems display. Users can quickly see if the patient has any inactive codes for the active problems. The \"#\" symbol shows the user that this active problem has an inactive code.\nIf the user tries to get a detailed display of the problem, the user first gets a warning about the inactive code.\nThe warning message instructs the user to correct the inactive code from the Problems tab. When the user closes the warning dialog, the detailed display then comes up. The \"#\" symbol in the detailed display also shows that the code is inactive.\nProblems Tab Display\nOn the Problems tab, users are alerted to inactive codes in two ways. The first time the user goes to the Problems tab if there are problems with inactive codes, a dialog displays that tells how many problems with inactive codes have been found.\nNote:      This dialog appears only the first time the user goes to the problems tab for that patient in a session. When the user closes the dialog, the Problems tab display. Problems with inactive codes have the \"#\" symbol in the status column.\n \nThe detailed display of a problem also indicates that the current code is inactive. Users should use the Change feature to associate the problem with an active code.\nEncounter Form Display\nThe Diagnoses tab of the Encounter dialog displays a \"#\" next to the code if the code is inactive.\nIf the user tries to select that diagnosis the following warning displays that tells users about  codes that need to be updated through the Problems tab.\n \nConsults Tab Display\nFor Consults and Procedures, only active codes will be allowed for the following functions:\n\n\nLexicon look up for provisional diagnosis as of the ordering date\n\n\nCopying or changing existing orders (the consult or procedure will not be accepted until a valid code is selected)\n\n\nEdit/Resubmit, the original code will be checked to see if it is active, if it is inactive an active code will need to be entered before CPRS will accept it\n\n\n \nClinical Reminders\nCPRS GUI will only display codes that were active in the reminder date range.\n \n\n\n","Path::contents/Left_arrow.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/cprswt.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Left_arrow.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/cprswt.css"}],"Path::contents/Left_arrow.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Left_arrow.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Left_arrow.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Left_arrow.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Left_arrow.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Left_arrow.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Left_arrow.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Left_arrow.htm::Title":"Left arrow","Path::contents/Left_arrow.htm::InnerText":"\nRemoves selected reminders from being displayed on the cover sheet.\n\n\n","Path::contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Personal_Preferences_(Tools___Options).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Personal_Preferences_(Tools___Options).htm"},{"origLink":"General_tab_(Tools___Options).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/General_tab_(Tools___Options).htm"},{"origLink":"General_tab_(Tools___Options).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/General_tab_(Tools___Options).htm"},{"origLink":"Order_Checks_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Order_Checks_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm"},{"origLink":"Notes_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Notes_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm"},{"origLink":"Reports_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Reports_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm"},{"origLink":"Graphs_Tab_Tools_Options_.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Graphs_Tab_Tools_Options_.htm"}],"Path::contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::Title":"Lists/Teams Tab (Tools | Options)","Path::contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Date,Date:range,list:personal patient and team,Order Checking:removing non-mandatory checks,Patient:selection (opening a record),Personal,Personal:diagnosis list,Personal:lists,Personal:Preferences: Lists/Teams,source combination,Team/Lists,Team/Lists:patient selection defaults,Team/Lists:personal lists,Team/Lists:source combinations,Team/Lists:team information,Tools | Options:list/teams patient selection defaults","Path::contents/Lists_Teams_Tab_(Tools___Options).htm::InnerText":"\nLists/Teams Tab (Tools | Options)\nThe Lists/Teams tab allows you to set defaults for selecting patients.

CPRS, Outpatient Pharmacy, and Inpatient Medications developers have made changes that enable users to enter this information into the medical record so that providers have a better picture of the medications the patient is taking and that order checks against these medications can occur.\n \nMaking Non-VA Meds Available for Entry\nFor users to be able to enter these medications through CPRS, they must be in the CPRS Orderable Items file so that they appear when the user chooses the new order sheet. The Pharmacy patch (PSS*1.0*68) enables sites to mark items as Non-VA Medications. Initially, all Pharmacy orderable items that are marked as \"outpatient\" and are not supply items will be automatically made Non-VA medications. Subsequently, Pharmacy coordinators can use the Pharmacy option Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] to identify items as Non-VA Meds or remove the designation.\nNote: For more information about how to get Non-VA Medications added to the appropriate file, please see \"Section 5.1: Communicating New Non-VA Meds Entries to the Pharmacist\" in the Herbal/OTC/Non-VA Meds Documentation Release Notes that will be located on the VistA Documentation Library at http://www.domain/vdl under the Outpatient Pharmacy listings.\n \nItems identified as \"Non-VA Meds\" are copied into the CPRS Orderable Items file when the Order Entry patch (OR*3.0*176) is installed at your site. Then, when CPRS GUI version 24 is installed, the item \"Meds, Non-VA\" is added under the Write Orders pane on the Orders tab. When the user selects the Meds, Non-VA option, the dialog displays the items that were marked as Non-VA Meds and copied into the CPRS Orderable Items file.\n \nDifferent from Ordering Medications\nRemember that entering Non-VA Medications is not the same as placing orders. Users simply enter information to provide a more complete view of what the patient is taking. However, once the items are available in the CPRS Orderable Items file, the process for entering Non-VA Medications is similar to entering other orders, but there are a few differences:\n·      Almost any CPRS user can enter Non-VA medication information. However, sites can restrict access for those holding the OREMAS key by using the OR OREMAS NON-VA MEDS parameter. For more information about this parameter, please see the CPRS Technical Manual: GUI Version.\n·      Users can enter Non-VA medication even if they only have partial information. The only required information is the non-VA or herbal medication name. The Medication name must be one that can be selected from the list. The Dosage, Route, and Schedule fields are optional and will accept free-text entries.\n·      Non-VA medications are listed separately on the orders tab and the designation \"Non-VA Med\" is displayed at the beginning of the entry.\n·      Users need to pick a reason why the patient is taking the Non-VA medication.\n \nFor the reason/statement that users should enter, developers sent out four reasons or statements at the package level of the parameter GUI Non-VA Med Statements/Reasons that were agreed upon by a workgroup:\n·      Non-VA medication not recommended by VA provider.\n·      Non-VA medication recommended by VA provider.\n·      Patient wants to buy from Non-VA pharmacy.\n·      Medication prescribed by Non-VA provider.\n \nAuthorized users can enter their own reasons/statements in the parameter by entering new statements at the System or Division level for this parameter.

Clinical \n events, such as a critical lab value or a change in orders trigger a notification \n to be sent to all recipients identified by the triggering package (such \n as Lab, CPRS, or Radiology). The notifications are located at the bottom \n of the Patient Selection screen.\nThere are two different listings for \n Notifications, Provider-centric and patient-centric. Provider-centric \n notifications are shown on the Patient selection screen and all pertain \n to the user that is logged in. For Patient-centric notifications or alerts, \n the user selects the View Patient Notifications under the File menu to \n bring them up  in their own dialog box.\n\n\tProvider-centric: The listing on the Patient \n\t Selection screen shows all notifications for the provider\n\t\n\tThis capture shows \n\t the Provider-centric view of Notifications on the Patient Selection \n\t screen.\n\t\n\t\n\tPatient-Centric: \n\t This listing reached by selecting File | View Patient’s Notifications…. \n\t The main difference is that all notifications listed in this dialog \n\t relate to the current patient only.   \n\n\nThis screen capture shows how to bring up the Patient-Centric Notifications \n using File | View Patient's Notifications\n \n\n\n\t\nAfter \n a patient is selected, the user can view all notifications for the selected \n patient. New columns include “My To Do” and the “Ordering Provider” and \n the user can process, defer, or close the dialog. The date range of displayed \n alerts is also customizable.\n \nAction, Informational, and Long Text Informational Alerts\n\n\tAction alerts: When you process notifications \n\t that require an action, such as signing an order, CPRS brings up the \n\t chart tab and the specific item (such as a note requiring a signature) \n\t that requires action.\n\t Informational alerts: CPRS places an \n\t “I” before “information-only” notifications. Once you view (process) \n\t information-only notifications, CPRS deletes them.\n\tLong Text Information alerts: CPRS places \n\t an “L” before a long alert. Long alerts have more text than will fit \n\t on one line as alerts are normally displayed. Processing the alert \n\t will bring up a dialog with additional actions.\n\nAction Alerts Require User Interaction\nFor action alerts, users can select the alert and \n CPRS will take them to the appropriate tab to complete the action. This \n may be to view a lab result, sign orders or notes, respond to System for \n Mammogram Results Tracking (SMART) notifications, etc.\n \nSMART notifications are new with CPRS v31b. When users \n process a SMART notification, they are taken to a progress note title \n containing a Reminder dialog for them to complete.\n \nFrom \n the main listing, users can also Remove, Renew, Forward or Defer notifications.\n\n\tRemoving \n\t notifications is the same as deleting them. \n\t A new parameter (ORB REMOVE) enables your site to identify which notifications \n\t can be removed without processing.\n\tRenewing notifications \n\t is useful when a user is processing a view alert, such as an abnormal \n\t lab result, and decides that the alert should not go away after the \n\t user views it. In this case, the user can renew the alert and it will \n\t still be there the next time the user logs in to CPRS.\n\t Forwarding notifications enables users to send an alert to someone \n\t else at the site. The user can choose \n\t from the list of names that is in your site's New Person file.\n\tDeferring notifications \n\t enables a user to defer acting on a notification, but the notification \n\t will again display in 14 days. Users can defer notifications as many \n\t times as they choose until the system removes them.\n\nNote:      As a default, all Notifications are \n disabled. Information Resources Management (IRM) staff and Clinical Coordinators \n enable specific notifications by setting site parameters through the Notifications \n Management Menus in the List Manager version of CPRS. These specific Notifications \n are initially sent to all users. Users can then disable unwanted Notifications \n as desired, through List Manager's Personal Preferences. Some notifications \n are mandatory and cannot be disabled.\n \nNotifications are retained \n for a predetermined amount of time (up to 30 days), after which they may \n be sent to another destination, such as your MailMan surrogate or your \n supervisor.

If a surrogate user chooses to use this button to remove pending notifications, all alerts are deleted, even if they are for actions such as requiring signature.  The alerts are deleted not only for the surrogate but also the user they are a surrogate for. The alerts are permanently deleted for the surrogate, never to be regenerated, even if they have not been processed.  However, if the alerts have not been processed by the surrogate, some may be returned to the original user based on a certain set of rules implemented in the Kernel.\n \n                 The following are the set of rules. When the surrogacy period expires and unprocessed surrogate alerts have not been returned yet, the alerts sent to the surrogate(s) for the user are checked. \n§      If the surrogate has processed an alert, it is ignored. \n§      If the surrogate has not processed an alert originally intended for the user, it is returned to the originally intended recipient. \n§      If the unprocessed alert was also sent to the surrogate as an initial recipient, then the alert is also retained by the surrogate. \n§      If the alert was forwarded to the surrogate, but meant only to be sent to the original user, then the alert is electronically removed from the surrogate's notification list. \n§      Any unprocessed alerts that are retained by the surrogate will require manual intervention to remove them.\n \n                        There is no difference in how informational vs. action notifications are managed with respect to surrogacy. The above rules are applicable regardless of the type of notification.\n                        Please use care when using this button to remove pending notifications, especially if you are designated as a surrogate for another user, as patient care may be delayed until the original provider returns.\n \nTo remove pending notifications, if necessary, use the following steps:\n1.     Select the Remove Pending Notifications button and then on Yes on the Warning dialog to clear all of your current pending notifications.

These order checks are designated by the \"*Order Check requires Reason for Override\" text in red and the order check text in blue.\nThis dialog displays each medication or other item that had an order check in a separate section. Each item will have a check box allowing the user to check any orders that should be canceled at this point. Under the order text, the order checks are displayed, the most serious order checks are listed first. Those with High Clinical Danger Level items are displayed first, labeled as high danger, and colored blue. To accept these orders, the clinician must enter an override reason to justify accepting the order.\nWhether the order check requires the clinician to enter a justification depends of how each site has set the Clinical Danger Level for each order check. For example, the Pharmacy package determines if an interaction is critical or significant. Each site then determines whether the provider must enter a reason for override by setting a Clinical Danger Level in CPRS for the Critical Drug Interaction and Significant Drug Interaction order checks.\nAnother example would be allergy assessments. If the site has the No Allergy Assessment order check set Clinical Danger Level to High and the patient does not have an allergy assessment, then the order will require a justification for override. If the site has the Clinical Danger Level to Moderate, no reason is required.\nWhen a user enters a high clinical danger level override reason, the reason for override is sent with the orders to ancillary packages so that the information is available to their users.\nThe new dialog also has a See Monograph button. The button will not be active until after the release of the first portion of the Pharmacy Reengineering project. Selecting the See Monograph button will send the user to a monograph about the drug or drug class to help the provider with additional information. If there are more than one kind of drug, the Monographs for Order Checks dialog will displays a drop-down list with the choices for the various kinds of medications.\n \nRelated topics\nOrder Checking

Checking is based on a system of rules that reviews orders to see if they meet defined criteria.

The provider can then choose to cancel the order or override the order check and place the order.\nThe Order Checking system gives users and clinical application coordinators (CACs) some flexibility to determine which order checks and notifications are sent and whether the provider must enter a reason to override the order check. To accomplish this, CPRS includes several prepackaged order checks as well as three menus for setting Order Checking parameters such as enabling and disabling specific order checks. Order Checks can also be configured to be mandatory by the Clinical Coordinator or IRM. If this feature is enabled, users cannot indicate that they do not want to receive individual order checks.

possible to perform a limited number of order checks against remote outpatient pharmacy and allergy information from other Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities that is stored in the Health Data Repository (HDR). Another project, the Clinical Health Data Repository (CHDR) will enable remote order checks against allergies and outpatient medication data from Department of Defense (DoD) facility data that is stored in the HDR. The CHDR data only relates to active dual consumers (patients that are seen at both VHA and DoD facilities).\nFor the selected patient, RDI requests from the HDR all outpatient pharmacy data with an expiration or discontinued date starting 30 days in the past and going forward, including into the future.\nWhat Remote Order Checks Are Available?\nWith RDI and CHDR, the following order checks occur:\n·      Allergy Contrast Media Interaction\n·      Allergy-Drug Interaction\n·      Critical Drug Interaction\n·      Duplicate Drug Class Order\n·      Duplicate Drug Order\n·      Significant Drug Interaction \n \nWhich Items Are NOT Used in Remote Order Checks?\nSome items are not used in remote order checking because they are not stored in the HDR. Others have a high annoyance factor and therefore were not included at the request of field sites. The following items are not included in remote order checks:\n·      Inpatient Medications\n·      Non-VA Meds\n·      Supply items\n·      Local drugs that are not matched to the National Drug File \nNote:      The HDR-Hx and HDR-IMS contain prescriptions with drugs that are not matched to the National Drug File (NDF). This prescription data should be used in remote order checking for duplicate drug classes. Because the National Drug File is updated regularly, these missing order checks could be resolved whenever the NDF is updated. Some drugs may never be matched, especially drugs used in research.\n \nWill the Display Change?\nWith RDI, if an order check finds a problem, CPRS displays the information to the user. The dialog is the same one that CPRS users are accustomed to with the addition of some additional information:\n·      Medication orders include the last refill date and the quantity.\n·      Remote medication order checks also display the facility name where the medication was prescribed. The facility information is provided as a convenience should the user need to get further information from the facility. Local medication order checks do not have any text where the facility name would be.\n·      For allergies, the facility name where the allergy was recorded, reactant, signs, and symptoms are shown.\n·      Allergies are sorted in the following manner:\n\nAllergies are sorted by clinical danger level\nIn cases where allergy severity and symptoms are identical in one or more order checks, a single consolidated order check will display to the user. The sort order hierarchy is:\n\n\nfirst by Severity (Highest to Lowest)\nsecond by Causative Agent\nlast by Local and Remote locations\n\n\n\n \nExamples of the order check screen with remote facility names in the order checks are shown below.\n\nThis screen capture shows sample order checks. At the end of possible interactions, CPRS displays the remote medication order’s location and for allergies, displays the allergy’s location. In this example, “4th Medical Group” denotes a DoD medical facility and “Cleveland” is a remote VAMC.\n \n\nThis screen capture shows a duplicate therapy warning, a general dosing check, and a message that the daily dose range check could not be performed because of missing data.\n \n\nThis screen capture shows sample order checks. Red boxes have been added to show where CPRS displays the remote medication order’s location, in this case a Department of Defense medical facility. The red boxes are for emphasis and do not display in CPRS. In this example, “4th Medical Group” denotes a DoD medical facility. Order checks also indicate if a monograph is available that contains additional information.\n \nTo ensure that providers have the information they need, CPRS also provides the message \"Remote Order Checking not available-- checks done on local data only\" if CPRS cannot communicate with remote sources.\n\nIf CPRS receives no data from the HDR, it indicates this in the message to the provider. The box and arrow are added here to show how the message will display.\n \nCPRS shows this message once during an ordering session when it cannot communicate with the HDR and then does not show it again until the user begins another ordering session. However, after displaying the message, CPRS continues to attempt communication with the HDR. If CPRS reaches the HDR, remote order checks will display when orders are placed.\n \nHow Is RDI Remote Order Checking Enabled?\nTo use remote order checking, your site must enable a parameter to access HDR data. This parameter is set for the entire facility.\nWhen Does CPRS Get Remote Data?\nOrder checks from CPRS can happen several times during a CPRS ordering session:\n·      Beginning to write/copy/change orders -  When a user selects an order menu to begin writing orders, CPRS requests some order checks, such as polypharmacy, renal function, or creatinine clearance, for example.\n·      On order acceptance  - When the user selects Accept, CPRS requests the order checks.\n·      Signature of orders - When a user signs the order, CPRS requests order checks.\n \nHow Long Is the Data Used?\nA parameter that sites can set controls how long HDR data is stored locally and is considered \"fresh\" and can be used for order checks before the data will be retrieved again from the HDR. The default time for this parameter is 120 minutes or two hours, but each site can change the time in that parameter.\n \nRelated topics\nOrder Checking Overview\nSite-Defined Clinical Reminder Order Checks\nOrder Checking Local\nOrdering a Diet\nOrdering Inpatient Medications (Simple Dose)\nOrdering Inpatient Medications (Complex Dose)\nOrdering Outpatient Medications (Simple Dose)\nOrdering Outpatient Medications (Complex Dose)\nOrdering IV Fluids\nOrdering Lab Tests\nOrdering Radiology and Imaging Procedures\nOrdering a Consult\nOrdering Vitals\nText Only Orders\nEvent-Delayed Orders\n \n\n\n","Path::contents/Ordering_Continuous_Clinic_Infusions.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/images/Clinic_Infuse_confirm.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Ordering_Continuous_Clinic_Infusions.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Clinic_Infuse_confirm.gif"},{"origLink":"assets/images/Clinic_Infuse_order_dialog.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Ordering_Continuous_Clinic_Infusions.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Clinic_Infuse_order_dialog.gif"},{"origLink":"assets/images/Clinic_Infuse_cont_vs_Intermit_2015-05-11.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Ordering_Continuous_Clinic_Infusions.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Clinic_Infuse_cont_vs_Intermit_2015-05-11.gif"},{"origLink":"Clinic_Infusions_(Overview).htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Continuous_Clinic_Infusions.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Clinic_Infusions_(Overview).htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Intermittent_Clinic_Infusions.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Continuous_Clinic_Infusions.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Intermittent_Clinic_Infusions.htm"},{"origLink":"One-Step_Clinic_Unit_Dose_Medication_Administration.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Continuous_Clinic_Infusions.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/One-Step_Clinic_Unit_Dose_Medication_Administration.htm"},{"origLink":"One-Step_Clinic_Administration_for_IV_Medications.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Continuous_Clinic_Infusions.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/One-Step_Clinic_Administration_for_IV_Medications.htm"}],"Path::contents/Ordering_Continuous_Clinic_Infusions.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Continuous_Clinic_Infusions.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Continuous_Clinic_Infusions.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Continuous_Clinic_Infusions.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Continuous_Clinic_Infusions.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Continuous_Clinic_Infusions.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Continuous_Clinic_Infusions.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Continuous_Clinic_Infusions.htm::Title":"Ordering Continuous Clinic Infusions","Path::contents/Ordering_Continuous_Clinic_Infusions.htm::InnerText":"\nOrdering Continuous Clinic Infusions\nContinuous infusion orders run at a specified rate.

This is a safety feature to ensure the patient does not receive a dangerous amount of fluid.\n\nEnter any comments (if necessary).\nReview the order text at the bottom of the dialog to ensure that it is correct. Make any necessary corrections.\nSelect Accept Order.\nReview order check items and respond appropriately. If the order should not be entered because of a possible interaction, select Cancel. If the order is okay to accept, select Accept Order.\nTo enter additional Clinic Infusion orders, repeat steps 6-19 as needed. To finish, select Quit. For an outpatient, when you select quit, the encounter location will remain with the current clinic. For an inpatient, when you select Quit, the encounter location will go back to the location where the patient was before you began entering Clinic Infusion orders.\nNote:   The order must be signed before it is sent.

outpatient,Orders,Orders:inpatient for outpatient","Path::contents/Ordering_Complex_Clinic_Medications.htm::InnerText":"\nOrdering Complex Clinic Medications\nCPRS enables providers to place complex Clinic Medication orders. These orders must be placed from a clinic location. CPRS will ask you to confirm that you are placing a Clinic Medication order. You will also have to change the encounter location to an appropriate clinic. For outpatients, you will be prompted if no encounter location has been defined yet and then asked to confirm that you want to order Clinic Medications. For inpatients, you will be asked to confirm that you want to order Clinic Medications first and then prompted for an appropriate clinic location.\nIn a complex dose order, the user must define specific characteristics for the order. Because the dose can affect the quantity, for example, changing certain fields may cause the quantity field to either recalculate or reset to zero to force the user to enter the quantity.\nTo order complex Clinic Medication orders, use the following steps:\n\nSelect the Orders tab.\nFrom the Write Orders pane, select Clinic Medications.\nNote:   Depending on how menus are set up at your particular site, you may need to select a different option from the Write Orders pane. Many sites have customized the items in the Write Orders pane. Check with your CAC (or the person who manages information resources at your site) if you have trouble locating the Clinic Medications item.\nNote:  The following prompts will be slightly different based on the patient’s location. You will be asked to verify that you want to write Clinic Medications and to ensure that the encounter location is a clinic location\n\nIf prompted, enter the appropriate clinic for the encounter information. This will generally happen with an outpatient that does not yet have an encounter defined.\nYou can use an existing appointment if one exists or create a new one. To use Clinic Medications, you must enter a location that was previously defined clinic. If you chose a clinic location, you will see this dialog.\n\nThis dialog is to ensure that the user knows they are about to enter Clinic Medications.\n \n\nTo continue ordering Clinic Medications, select Yes and continue to the next step. To stop the Clinic Medications process, choose No.\n(Conditional) If the patient’s current location is not a clinic, you will be asked if you want to change the patient’s location.\nIn the Clinic Medications dialog, locate the medication name or quick order name in the list box by typing characters in the Medication field\nNote:  CPRS now only auto-selects (highlights in blue and places that entry in the field) a medication, dosage, route, or schedule if the user types enough characters to uniquely identify an item in the list. If the user does not enter enough characters to uniquely identify an item, CPRS waits until the user manually selects an item using the mouse or the keyboard.\n \n\n\nSelect the quick order or medication name using the mouse or keyboard.\nOnce the name is selected, CPRS displays a second dialog to select the items for the rest of the order. In the top field of the second dialog, the generic medication name and the synonym (usually a brand name) are displayed\nNote:  If the selected medication is a controlled substance that requires the signature of a provider with a DEA or VA number, the DEA# Required dialog appears. CPRS allows orders for controlled substances only when selected providers are able to sign the orders. You may need to exit the Medication Order dialog, change the provider selection, and then reenter the dialog.\n\nYou must have a DEA# or VA# to order certain medications\n \n\nSelect the Complex tab.\nNote:  After you begin a complex dose medication order, you must remain on the Complex tab until you finish the order. If you switch to the Dosage tab, CPRS clears all complex dosages and you will be forced to start again.\n \n\nSelect the Dosage field and select the appropriate dosage.\nThe dosage may not begin with a decimal, for example .5; it must begin with a numerical value, 0.5 for example. Also, the character “^” may not be entered in the Dosage field. (The associated cost is displayed to the right of the dosage.)\nNote:   CPRS now only auto-selects (highlights in blue and places that entry in the field) a medication, dosage, route, or schedule if the user types enough characters to uniquely identify an item in the list. If the user does not enter enough characters to uniquely identify an item, CPRS waits until the user manually selects an item using the mouse or the keyboard.\n \n\nEnter a Route by either selecting one from the list or typing in a valid route.\nWhen the user selects a regular schedule that does not have PRN, the administration times may display in the Schedule column. The administration times will display if they have been defined for the ward or if there is a default\n \n\nIf you selected an existing schedule, skip to step 13. If you selected OTHER, CPRS displays the Order with Schedule ‘OTHER’ dialog. Take the following steps:\n\nSelect one or more check boxes by the appropriate days of the week.\nIf the schedule requires specific administration times skip to steps c and d. To select a schedule from the list, highlight the schedule and select Add\nNote:   Users can assign either a schedule from the list or specific administration times, but not both. If launched from the Complex tab, the Day-of-Week Schedule builder does not display one-time schedules in the schedule list. Also, because the user is specifying days of the week and a schedule, the list will contain only schedules less than 24 hours (for example, Q36H will not be in the list).\n \n\nTo use a specific administration time, select the hour and minutes (if the user only selects the hour, the minutes will default to zero) and select Add\nRepeat step c until you have entered all required administration times\nWARNING:      The administration times in the Schedule field apply to each day of the week that is listed, such as TU-TH-SA@0800-2000, for example. To create a schedule such as TU@0800 TH@2000, users would have to enter two separate orders using the complex medication order dialog. Also, users may not enter a schedule that only has administration times and PRN but no days.\n \n\nIf you make a mistake while selecting an administration time or schedule, do one of the following to remove it.\n\nFor a single administration time, highlight the hour and minutes in the Set Administration Time fields and select Remove (so to remove 08:00, you would have to select that time in the Set Administration Time fields not in the Schedule text box.)\nTo remove the schedule, highlight the schedule and select Remove.\nTo remove the entire schedule and begin again with step a, select Reset\n\n\nReview the Schedule field.\nWhen you have the correct schedule, select OK.\n\nThe Order with Schedule ‘OTHER’ dialog allows you to enter a customized day-of-week and/or administration-time schedule. The user can enter specific administration times or select a schedule from the available list.\n \n\n\n\nIf necessary, select PRN.\nPRN will display in the schedule field if the PRN checkbox is checked or if the schedule is defined in the Pharmacy files as a PRN schedule\n \n\nSelect the Duration field and select the amount of time that the patient should use the specified dose.\nIn the then/and field, select the appropriate conjunction for the order.\nNote:   The conjunction “Then” requires a duration to be added.\n \n\nSelect the next row in the Dosage field and type or select a dosage.\nThe dosage may not begin with a decimal, for example .5; it must begin with a numerical value, 0.5 for example. Also, the character “^” may not be entered in the Dosage field. (The associated cost is displayed to the right of the dosage.)\n \n\nCPRS fills in the Route and Schedule fields. You can change the values in these fields if necessary.\nSelect a duration and a conjunction (then or and) except on the final row\nNote:  Your site’s IRM staff may have specified rules governing the status of inpatient medication orders when patients are transferred from one ward or service to another. It may have also specified the number of days an inpatient medication order remains active. Please check with your site’s IRM staff for information about these rules.\n \n\nRepeat steps 15-18 until you have completed the complex dose.\nNote:  You can also add or remove a row in the complex dose. To add a row, select the gray area in front of the row and select Add Row (CPRS places the new row above the selected row). To delete a row, click the gray area in front of the row you wish to delete and select Delete Row.\n \n\nAdd comments (optional).\nThe date and time that the patient is scheduled to receive the first dose of the medication appears under the Comments field. (For example, CPRS cannot show an expected first dose for “on call” or schedules with PRN. On the complex tab, it will not try to determine an expected first dose after a THEN because the first item must be completed.)\n\nIf you want the patient to receive an additional dose now, select the Give additional dose now check box. If you select the check box, the Give Additional Dose Now for Complex Order warning dialog box appears, as shown below.\n\nThis graphic shows an example of the Give Additional Dose Now for Complex Order warning.\n \nNote:   Make sure that you are careful about using give-additional-dose-now functionality. When you click the check box, CPRS creates two new orders and sends it to Inpatient Medications. Make sure the “Give additional dose now” and the regular order with the original schedule you entered do not overmedicate the patient. “Give additional dose now” is not available for ONCE, ONE-TIME, or NOW orders. It is also not available for delayed orders.\n \n\nCheck the orders and then select OK to close the warning dialog.\nChoose a priority from the Priority drop-down list.\nSelect Accept Order.\nNote:   If you do not complete the mandatory items, or if the information is incorrect, CPRS sends a message to tell you that the information is incorrect and shows you the correct type of response.\n \n\n(Conditional) If the medication ordered may be contraindicated because of allergies, drug interactions, or duplicate orders, CPRS will display the Order Check window. Carefully review all order checks and decide if the medication should be ordered. Do one of the following.\n\nTo proceed, select Accept Order.\nTo stop the ordering process and return to the dialog, Cancel Order.\n\n \n\nEnter another medication order.\n-or-\nselect Quit.\n \n\nWhen you select Quit, if the patient is in inpatient, CPRS changes the patient’s location back to where the patient was before changing to the clinic.\n\n \nOn the Orders tab, CPRS displays Clinic Medications in the Clinic Medications display group, with the clinic location in the Location column.\n\n \nRelated topics\nClinic Medications (Overview)\nOrdering Simple Clinic

Of course to order these infusions, the patient must be assigned a clinic location. Intermittent refers to an infusion order administered at scheduled intervals (Q4H, QDAY) or One-Time only, “over a specified period of time” (e.g., “Infuse over 30 min.”). For intermittent infusion orders, as the user selects a solution and/or additive, the items from that list are displayed to the right under Solution/Additive. For Intermittent infusion orders the only optional fields are the Comments, Infuse Over, and the Duration or Total Volume fields.\nHowever, for intermittent orders, the Infusion Rate field changes to the Infuse Over Time field where the user enters either a number of minutes or hours. the schedule field is not available.\nTo order intermittent Clinic Infusion orders, follow these steps:\n\nSelect the Orders tab.\nFrom the Write Orders pane, select Clinic Infusions.\nNote:   Depending on how menus are set up at your particular site, you may need to select a different option from the Write Orders pane. Many sites have customized the items in the Write Orders pane. Check with your CAC (or the person who manages information resources at your site) if you have trouble locating the Clinic Infusions item.\nNote:   The following prompts will be slightly different based on the patient’s location. You will be asked to verify that you want to write Clinic Infusions and to ensure that the encounter location is a clinic location.\n\nIf prompted, enter the appropriate clinic for the encounter information. This will generally happen with an outpatient that does not yet have an encounter defined.\nYou can use an existing appointment if one exists or create a new one. To use Clinic Infusions, you must enter a location that was previously defined clinic. If you chose a clinic location, you will see this dialog.\n\nThis dialog is to ensure that the user knows they are about to enter Clinic Infusions.\n\nTo continue ordering Clinic Medications, select Yes and continue to the next step. To stop the Clinic Medications process, choose No.\n(Conditional) If the patient’s current location is not a clinic, change the patient’s location to the appropriate clinic.\nThe Clinic Infusion Order dialog displays.\n\nThe Infusion Order dialog for continuous infusion orders does not use a schedule, but it does have an infusion rate. For\ncontinuous infusion orders, the new Additive Frequency field enables providers to indicate into which IV bag the additive\nshould be placed.\n\nSelect the needed solutions from the Solutions tab.\nSelect an additive from the list (if necessary) and edit the strength if needed. Repeat for additional additives if necessary. How users can edit the strength field will depend on the values for strength defined in the pharmacy files as follows:\nThe solution and additives you select will appear in the Solution/Additive grid.\nNote:   To remove an additive or a solution, select the solution or additive and select Remove.\n\nSelect a Route (such as intravenous, epidural, IV piggyback, etc.) If the desired route is not available, select the Other option in the list of routes to bring the expanded med route form that lists all possible IV routes.\nIn the Type drop-down box, select Intermittent.\nNote:   If you change the IV Type from Intermittent to Continuous, the Schedule field becomes unavailable (greyed out) and the Infusion over Time field becomes the Infusion Rate field.\nNote:   For a definition of Continuous and Intermittent orders, select the IV Type Help link and a message box will display with a short definition of what the terms mean.\n\nTo help providers enter the correct type of infusion order, this dialog provides\na definition of Continuous and Intermittent infusion orders.\n\nSelect a schedule from the list or create one using the Day-of-Week schedule builder.\nNote:   When a user writes an intermittent infusion order with a schedule of ONCE, the following will happen in CPRS:\n\n\n\nThe DURATION field will be disabled.\nThe Give Additional Dose Now option will be disabled.\nExpected First Dose and Administration Times will not be displayed.\n\n\n\nNote:   When a user writes an intermittent infusion order with a schedule of On Call or a PRN, the following will happen in CPRS:\n\n\n\nExpected First Dose and Administration Times will not be displayed.\n\n\n\n\nIf you selected an existing schedule, skip to step 14. If you selected OTHER, CPRS displays the Order with Schedule ‘OTHER’ dialog. Take the following steps:\n\nSelect one or more checkboxes by the appropriate days of the week\nIf the schedule requires specific administration times skip to steps c and d. To select a schedule from the list, highlight the schedule and select Add.\nNote:   Users can assign either a schedule from the list or specific administration times, but not both.\n\nTo use a specific administration time, select the hour and minutes (if the user only selects the hour, the minutes will default to zero) and select Add.\nRepeat step c until you have entered all required administration times.\nWarning:The administration times in the Schedule field apply to each day of the week that is listed, such as TU-TH-SA@0800-2000, for example. To create a schedule such as TU@0800 TH@2000, users would have to enter two separate orders using the complex medication order dialog. Also, users may not enter a schedule that only has administration times and PRN but no days\n\nIf you make a mistake while selecting an administration time or schedule, do one of the following to remove it:\n\nFor a single administration time, highlight the hour and minutes in the Set Administration Time fields and select Remove (so to remove 08:00, you would have to select that time in the Set Administration Time fields not in the Schedule text box.)\nTo remove the schedule, highlight the schedule and select Remove.\nTo remove the entire schedule and begin again with step a, select Reset.\n\n\nReview the Schedule field.\nWhen you have the correct schedule, select OK.\n\n\nIf necessary, select the PRN checkbox\nEnter the number for the duration over which to infuse the medication.\nMove to the next field and select the unit of time (the units can be only Minutes or Hours) over which the infusion should be given.\nFor example, you might enter 30 for the number, move to the next field, and then select minutes to define infuse over 30 minutes.\n\nSelect the Priority\nEnter a number for the duration or total volume.\nMove to the next field and select the appropriate unit (liters-L, milliliters-ml, days, hours, or doses).\nNote:   If you change the units, the value in the Duration or the Total Volume field will be removed and you will need to enter it again. This is a safety feature to insure the patient does not receive a dangerous amount of fluid.\n\nIf necessary, select the Give additional dose now checkbox.\nNote:   Make sure that you are careful about using give-additional-dose-now functionality. When you click the check box, CPRS creates two new orders and sends it to Inpatient Medications. Make sure the “Give additional dose now” and the regular order with the original schedule you entered do not overmedicate the patient. “Give additional dose now” is not available for ONCE, ONE-TIME, or NOW orders. It is also not available for delayed orders.\n\nEnter any comments (if necessary).\nReview the order text at the bottom of the dialog to ensure that it is correct.\nIf the order text is correct, select Accept Order.\nReview order check items and respond appropriately. If the order should not be entered because of a possible interaction, select Cancel. If the order is okay to accept, select Accept Order.\nTo enter additional Clinic Infusion orders, repeat steps 6-19 as needed. To finish, select Quit. For an outpatient, when you select quit, the encounter location will remain with the current clinic. For an inpatient, when you select Quit, the encounter location will go back to the location where the patient was before you began entering Clinic Infusion orders\nNote:   The order must be signed before it is sent.

the ordering process and eliminates the dispense drug prompt. Inpatient medication orders now require a valid schedule. If users do not find the appropriate schedule in the list, they can choose to create a day-of-week/administration time schedule using the new Schedule builder. This feature also works for renewing, copying, and changing inpatient medication orders. The procedure for ordering medications is described below.\nNote:      Because a valid schedule is required, if you attempt to modify an existing medication order that does not have a valid schedule, you will receive a message box stating that and will have to enter a valid schedule.\nNote:      Your site's IRM staff may have specified rules governing the status of inpatient medication orders when patients are transferred from one ward or service to another. It may have also specified the number of days an inpatient medication order remains active. Please check with your site's IRM staff for information about these rules.\nCPRS now requires a unique match in the Medication, Dosage, Route, and Schedule fields for inpatient medications before CPRS will auto-select an item from the list. For inpatient medications, the Medication and Schedule fields must be an item from the list, but the Dosage and Route can be a free-text entry (the route must be in the MEDICATION ROUTES file #51.2). If the desired schedule is not on the list, the user can build a day-of-week/administration time schedule using the Schedule Builder.\nCPRS displays unit dose routes based on the following rules:\n1.     If a default medication route is defined in the orderable item file, CPRS displays only the default medication route for the Unit Dose orderable item in the medication route selection list.\n2.     If there is no default medication route defined for the orderable item, CPRS displays all possible medication routes for the dosage form to the provider for selection.\n3.     If there is only one possible medication route, it will be used as the default.\n4.     If a medication route name or its abbreviation is not included in the selection list, a user may type it in.\n \nAlso, medications that are not in the formulary display in the list with the letters \"NF\" after the name or synonym, which is also displayed. CPRS checks for non-formulary dosages (e.g., the VA formulary may not have a 2.5 MG pill, but it may have a 5.0 MG pill) and for non-formulary orderable items (e.g., the VA may not carry a specific kind of allergy medication).\nNew Clozapine Requirements\nWith the Food and Drug Administration required changes for administering Clozapine, the following criteria must be met for a provider to order Clozapine:\n·      The patient is part of the treatment program.\n·      The patient has proper WBC (White Blood Count) and ANC (Absolute Neutrophil Count) lab tests within the past 7 days.\n·      The ordering provider has the YSCL AUTHORIZED key.\n·      The ordering provider has a valid Drug Enforcement Agency number or Veterans Administration number (DEA/VA#).\n \nCPRS checks these criteria by calling an API provided by the Mental Health package that determines whether the patient should be permitted to receive the new prescription. CPRS gives order checks if the patient's lab test values are in the mid or low range as shown below:\n \nLab Test Ranges\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLow Range\n\n\nMid Range\n\n\nHigh Range\n\n\n\n\nWBC\n\n\n< 3\n\n\nbetween 3 and 3.5\n\n\n>3.5\n\n\n\n\nANC\n\n\n<1.5\n\n\nbetween 1.5 and 2\n\n\n>2\n\n\n\n \nThe labs test results determine what level of override is needed for the patient to receive Clozapine:\n·      High Range –No override needed.\n·      Mid Range –  Local override. This is like a normal medication order check and can be overridden at the local level.\n·      Low Range – National Clozapine Coordinating Center (NCCC) override required. If the patient's lab values are in the low range, the provider must contact the NCCC to receive an override that is valid for a single Clozapine order.\n \nThe other order checks related to Clozapine will continue to work as they have prior to these changes.\nAdditionally, the values of the Days Supply, Quantity, and Refills fields are restricted based on the type of patient that Mental Health designates in their files when the provider is ordering Clozapine. This can be a 7, 14, or 28-day recipient of the Clozapine drug. For refills, the following rules apply:\n·      Patients on a 7-day monitoring frequency have no refills available.\n·      Patients on a 14-day monitoring frequency can receive a full 14-day supply or a 7-day supply and ONE refill.\n·      Patients on a 28-day monitoring frequency can receive EITHER a full 28-day supply, or a 14-day supply and ONE refill, or a 7-day supply and THREE refills. \n \n \nCPRS now prevents the user from renewing outpatient and inpatient Clozapine orders.\n \nTo write a new Inpatient Medications order, follow these steps:\nNote:      If the user attempts to order inpatient medications for an inpatient from an outpatient location, CPRS discontinues the order process and returns the user to original Orders or Meds tab display.\n \n1.     Select the Meds tab and select Action | New Medication.\n-or-\nSelect Orders tab and bring up the Inpatient dialog by selecting the appropriate item under the Write Orders box.\n \n2.      Locate the desired medication or medication quick order.\nNote:      CPRS now only auto-selects (highlights in blue and places that entry in the field) a medication, dosage, route, or schedule if the user types enough characters to uniquely identify an item in the list. If the user does not enter enough characters to uniquely identify an item, CPRS waits until the user manually selects an item using the mouse or the keyboard.\n \n3.     Select the quick order or medication name. Once the name is selected, CPRS displays a second dialog to select the items for the rest of the order. In the top field of the second dialog, the generic medication name and the synonym (usually a brand name) are displayed.\nThe lab results for the most recent lab test associated with the selected medication are displayed in the Information field, if an associated lab test was performed within the last 365 days.\nNote:      A CAC or ADPAC will need to set the OR CPRS LAB DISPLAY ENABLED parameter to ON to activate the lab results display at a site.\n \nTo view associated lab results for Quick Orders, a TIU OBJECT must be inserted into the Quick Order. For more information, refer to the Text Integration Utility (TIU) Clinical Coordinator & User Manual. This functionality will work for generalized Quick Orders only (orders assigned to Order Menus). It is not currently implemented for personal Quick Orders.\n \nThe lab results functionality will not work properly for multi-divisional facilities or any sites that use different lab test names at different sites, as only one lab test name can be associated with each drug. To successfully implement this functionality, all facilities/divisions that share a VistA system must use the same name for each monitored lab test.\n \nNote:     CPRS now uses a look up from Pharmacy to check if the selected medication is a controlled substance that will require the signature of a provider with a DEA or VA number. A message will appear to the provider \"Provider must have DEA# or VA# to order this medication\". Before an order for a controlled substance can be entered, the provider selected for the encounter must be able to sign the order. You may need to exit the dialog, change the provider, and then reenter the dialog.\n \nClick here to see the inpatient medication selection dialog.\n \n4.     In the Dosage field, select or type a dosage.\nThe dosage may not begin with a decimal, for example .5; it must begin with a numerical value, 0.5 for example. Also, the character  \"^\"  may not be entered in the Dosage field. Also, the associated cost of the drug is displayed to the right of the dosage.\n \nNote:     CPRS now only auto-selects (highlights in blue and places that entry in the field) a medication, dosage, route, or schedule if the user types enough characters to uniquely identify an item in the list. If the user does not enter enough characters to uniquely identify an item, CPRS waits until the user manually selects an item using the mouse or the keyboard.\nOnce a dosage is selected, any lab test results displayed in the Information field are replaced by the National Standard Orderable Item information.\n5.     In the Route field, enter the appropriate route (a default route may have been set up) by either selecting one from the list or typing in a valid route.\n6.     Select a schedule or if the schedule you want to use is not in the list, locate the Other (you can also click the Non-Standard? link and then click OK on the dialog that displays) entry and select it. If you selected Other, use these instructions to create a customized schedule.\nNote:     See the second inpatient Medication Order dialog for a simple dose.\nWhen the user selects a schedule, the administration times may display under the \"Give additional dose now\" text. The administration times will display if they have been defined for the ward or if there is a default as long as the order is not a PRN order.\n \n7.     Select PRN if desired.\n8.     Add comments (optional).\n9.     CPRS displays when the first dose of the medication is expected to be given. (For example, CPRS cannot show an expected first dose for \"on call\" or schedules with PRN. On the complex tab, it will not try to determine an expected first dose after a THEN because the first item must be completed.) If you want to give an additional dose now, select to place a check in the \"Give additional dose now\" check box.\nNote:     Make sure that you are careful about using give-additional-dose-now functionality. When you click the check box, CPRS creates two new orders and sends it to Inpatient Medications. Make sure the \"Give additional dose now\" and the regular order with the original schedule you entered do not overmedicate the patient. \"Give additional dose now\" is not available for ONCE, ONE-TIME, or NOW orders. It is also not available for delayed orders.\n10.   Check the warning message to ensure that the orders you created are what you expected. If the orders are acceptable, click OK. If not, click Cancel to clear the Give additional dose now check box.\n11.   Select the drop-down arrow and select a Priority.\n12.   Select Accept Order.\nNote:      If you do not complete the mandatory items or if the information is incorrect, CPRS sends a message that tells you that the information is incorrect and shows you the correct type of response.\n13.   (Conditional) If the medication ordered may be contraindicated because of allergies, drug interactions, or duplicate orders, CPRS will display the Order Check window. Carefully review all order checks and decide if the medication should be ordered. Do one of the following:\no      To proceed, select Accept Order.\no      To stop the ordering process and return to the dialog, Cancel Order.\n \n14.   Enter another medication order\n-or-\nselect Quit.\nNote:     The order must be signed before it is sent to pharmacy.

Intermittent refers to an infusion order administered at scheduled intervals (Q4H, QDAY) or One-Time only, \"over a specified period of time\" (e.g., \"Infuse over 30 min.\"). For intermittent infusion orders, as the user selects a solution and/or additive, the items from that list are displayed to the right under Solution/Additive. For Intermittent infusion orders the only optional fields are the Comments, Infuse Over, and the Duration or Total Volume fields.\nHowever, for intermittent orders, the Infusion Rate field changes to the Infuse Over Time field where the user enters either a number of minutes or hours. the schedule field is not available.\nTo order intermittent infusion orders, follow these steps:\n1.     Select the Orders tab.\n2.     Select the active orders view from the View Orders pane\n-or-\nselect View | Active Orders (includes pending, recent activity).\n \n3.     Select Infusion (or your site's equivalent) in the Write Orders list box.\nNote:      The IV fluids item may be labeled differently or may not be available from your Write Orders list box.\n \nThe Infusion Order dialog displays as shown below.\n \n\nThe Infusion Order dialog for intermittent infusion orders\n \nNote:      If encounter information has not been entered, the encounter information dialog will appear before the Infusion Order dialog.

Repeat for additional additives if necessary.\nThe solution and additives you select will appear in the Solution/Additive grid.\nNote:      To remove an additive or a solution, select the solution or additive and select Remove.\n \n6.     Enter a volume and strength in the Solution/Additive grid (if necessary). If the desired route is not available select the Other option in the list of route to bring the expanded med route form that list all possible IV routes.\n7.     Select the Route (for example, intravenous, epidural, IV piggyback, etc) from the drop-down list.\n8.     In the Type drop-down box, select Intermittent.\nNote:      If you change the IV Type from Intermittent to Continuous, the Schedule field becomes unavailable (greyed out) and the Infusion over Time field becomes the Infusion Rate field.\nNote:      For a definition of Continuous and Intermittent orders, select the IV Type Help link and a message box will display with a short definition of what the terms mean.\n\n \n9.     Select a schedule from the list or create one using the Day-of-Week schedule builder.\nNote:      When a user writes an intermittent infusion order with a schedule of ONCE, the following will happen in CPRS:\n§     The DURATION field will be disabled.\n§     The Give Additional Dose Now option will be disabled\n§     Expected First Dose and Administration Times will not be displayed\n \nNote:      When a user writes an intermittent infusion order with a schedule of On Call or a PRN, the following will happen in CPRS:\n§     Expected First Dose and Administration Times will not be displayed\n \n10.   If you selected an existing schedule, skip to step 13. If you selected OTHER, CPRS displays the Order with Schedule \"OTHER\" dialog. Take the following steps:\na)    Select one or more check boxes by the appropriate days of the week.\nb)    If the schedule requires specific administration times skip to steps c and d. To select a schedule from the list, highlight the schedule and select Add.\nNote:      Users can assign either a schedule from the list or specific administration times, but not both.\n \nc)    To use a specific administration time, select the hour and minutes (if the user only selects the hour, the minutes will default to zero) and select Add.\nd)    Repeat step c until you have entered all required administration times.\nWarning:       The administration times in the Schedule field apply to each day of the week that is listed, such as TU-TH-SA@0800-2000, for example. To create a schedule such as TU@0800 TH@2000, users would have to enter two separate orders using the complex medication order dialog. Also, users may not enter a schedule that only has administration times and PRN but no days.\n \ne)    If you make a mistake while selecting an administration time or schedule, do one of the following to remove it:\n§     For a single administration time, highlight the hour and minutes in the Set Administration Time fields and select Remove (so to remove 08:00, you would have to select that time in the Set Administration Time fields not in the Schedule text box.)\n§     To remove the schedule, highlight the schedule and select Remove.\n§     To remove the entire schedule and begin again with step a, select Reset.\n \nf)    Review the Schedule field.\ng)    When you have the correct schedule, select OK.\n \n11.   If necessary, select the PRN check box.\n12.   Enter the number for the duration over which to infuse the medication.\n13.   Move to the next field and select the unit of time (the units can be only Minutes or Hours) over which the infusion should be given.\nFor example, you might enter 30 for the number, move to the next field, and then select minutes to define infuse over 30 minutes.\n \n14.   Select the Priority.\n15.   Enter a number for the duration or total volume.\n16.   Move to the next field and select the appropriate unit (liters-L, milliliters-ml, days, hours, or doses).\nNote:      If you change the units, the value in the Duration or the Total Volume field will be removed and you will need to enter it again. This is a safety feature to insure the patient does not receive a dangerous amount of fluid.\n \n17.   If necessary, select the Give additional dose now check box.\nNote:     Make sure that you are careful about using give-additional-dose-now functionality. When you click the check box, CPRS creates two new orders and sends it to Inpatient Medications.

ordering process and eliminates the dispense \n drug prompt. Inpatient medication orders now require a valid schedule. If users \n do not find the appropriate schedule in the list, they can choose to create \n a day-of-week/administration time schedule using the new Schedule builder. \n This feature also works for renewing, copying, and changing inpatient \n medication orders. The procedure for ordering medications \n is described below.\nNote:     Because \n a valid schedule is required, if you attempt to modify an existing medication \n order that does not have a valid schedule, you will receive a message \n box stating that and will have to enter \n a valid schedule.\nNote:     Your \n site's IRM staff may have specified rules governing the status of inpatient \n medication orders when patients are transferred from one ward or service \n to another. It may have also specified the number of days an inpatient \n medication order \n remains active. Please check with your site's IRM staff for information \n about these rules.\n \nCPRS now requires a unique \n match in the Medication, Dosage, Route, and Schedule fields for inpatient \n medications before CPRS will auto-select an item \n from the list. For inpatient medications, the Medication and Schedule \n fields must be an item from the list, but the Dosage and Route can be \n a free-text entry (the route must be in the MEDICATION ROUTES file #51.2). \n If the desired schedule is not on the list, \n the user can build a day-of-week/administration time schedule using the \n Schedule Builder.\nCPRS displays unit dose \n routes based on the following rules:\n1.     If \n a default medication route is defined in the orderable item file, CPRS \n displays only the \n default medication route for the Unit Dose orderable item in the medication \n route selection list.\n2.     If there is no default \n medication route defined for the orderable item, CPRS displays all possible \n medication routes for the dosage form to the provider for selection.\n3.     If there is only \n one possible medication route, it will be used as the default.\n4.     If a medication route \n name or its abbreviation is not included in the selection list, a user \n may type it in.\n \nAlso, medications that \n are not in the formulary display in the list with the letters \"NF\" \n after the name or synonym, which is also displayed. CPRS checks for non-formulary \n dosages (e.g., the VA formulary may not have a 2.5 MG pill, but it may \n have a 5.0 MG pill) and for non-formulary orderable items (e.g., \n the VA may not \n carry a specific kind of allergy medication).\nNew \n Clozapine Requirements\nWith the Food and Drug \n Administration required changes for administering Clozapine, the following \n criteria must be met for a provider to order Clozapine:\n·     The patient is part \n of the treatment program.\n·     The patient has proper \n WBC (White Blood Count) and ANC (Absolute Neutrophil Count) lab tests \n within the past 7 days.\n·     The ordering provider \n has the YSCL AUTHORIZED key.\n·     The ordering provider \n has a valid Drug Enforcement Agency number or Veterans Administration \n number (DEA/VA#).\n \nCPRS checks these criteria \n by calling an API provided by the Mental Health package that determines \n whether the patient should be permitted to receive the new prescription. \n CPRS gives order checks if the patient's lab test values are in the mid \n or low range as shown below:\n \nLab \n Test Ranges\n\n\t\n\t\t \n\t\tLow Range\n\t\tMid Range\n\t\tHigh Range\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWBC\n\t\t< 3\n\t\tbetween 3 and 3.5\n\t\t>3.5\n\t\n\t\n\t\tANC\n\t\t<1.5\n\t\tbetween 1.5 and 2\n\t\t>2\n\t\n\n \nThe labs test results \n determine what level of override is needed for the patient to receive \n Clozapine:\n·     High Range – No override needed.\n·     Mid Range –   Local override. This is like a normal medication order \n check and can be overridden at the local level.\n·     Low Range –   National Clozapine Coordinating Center (NCCC) override \n required. If the patient's lab values are in the low range, the provider \n must contact the NCCC to receive an override that is valid for a single \n Clozapine order.\n \nThe other order checks \n related to Clozapine \n will continue to work as they have prior to these changes.\nAdditionally, the values \n of the Days Supply, Quantity, and Refills fields are restricted based \n on the type of patient that Mental Health designates in their files when \n the provider \n is ordering Clozapine. This can be a 7, 14, or 28-day recipient of the \n Clozapine drug. For refills, the following rules apply:\n·     Patients on a 7-day \n monitoring frequency have no refills available.\n·     Patients on a 14-day \n monitoring frequency can receive a full 14-day supply or a 7-day \n supply and ONE refill.\n·     Patients on a \n 28-day monitoring frequency can receive EITHER a full 28-day supply, \n or a 14-day supply and ONE refill, or a 7-day supply and THREE refills. \n \n \nCPRS now prevents the \n user from renewing outpatient and inpatient Clozapine orders.\n \nTo write \n a new Inpatient Medications order, follow these steps:\nNote:      If \n the user attempts to order inpatient medications \n for an inpatient from an outpatient location, CPRS discontinues the order \n process and returns the user to original Orders or Meds tab display.\nIn a complex dose order, \n the user must define specific characteristics for the order. Because the \n dose can affect the quantity, for example, changing certain fields may cause the \n quantity field to either recalculate or reset to zero to force the user \n to enter the quantity.\n \n1.     Select the Meds \n tab and select Action \n | New Medication.\n-or-\nSelect the Orders \n tab and bring \n up the Inpatient dialog by clicking the appropriate \n item under the Write Orders box.\n \n2.     Locate \n the desired medication or medication quick order.\nNote:      CPRS \n now only auto-selects (highlights in blue and places that entry in the \n field) a medication, dosage, route, or schedule if the user types enough \n characters to uniquely identify an item in the list. If the user does \n not enter enough characters to uniquely identify an item, CPRS waits until \n the user manually selects an item using the mouse or the keyboard.\n \n3.     Select the quick \n order or medication name. Once the name is selected, CPRS \n displays a second dialog to select the items for the rest of the order. \n In the top field of the second dialog, the generic medication name and \n the synonym (usually a brand name) are \n displayed.\nThe lab results for the most recent \n lab test associated with the selected medication are displayed in the \n Information field, if an associated lab test was performed within the \n last 365 days.\nNote:      A \n CAC or ADPAC will need to set the OR \n CPRS LAB DISPLAY ENABLED parameter to ON to activate the lab results \n display at a site.\n \n To view associated lab results \n for Quick Orders, a TIU OBJECT must be inserted into the Quick Order. \n For more information, refer to the Text Integration Utility (TIU) Clinical \n Coordinator & User Manual. This \n functionality will work for generalized Quick Orders only (orders assigned \n to Order Menus). It is not currently implemented for personal Quick Orders.\n \n                The \n lab results functionality will not work properly for multi-divisional \n facilities or any sites that use different lab test names at different \n sites, as only one lab test name can be associated with each drug. To \n successfully implement this functionality, all facilities/divisions that \n share a VistA system must use the same name for each monitored lab test.\nNote:     CPRS \n now uses a look up from Pharmacy to check if the selected medication is \n a controlled substance that will require the signature of a provider with \n a DEA or VA number. A message will appear to the provider \"Provider \n must have DEA# or \n VA# to order this medication\" as shown in the graphic below.

Users must enter a medication name, dosage, route, and schedule. For outpatient medications, dosage, schedule, and route can be free-text entries, but the medication must be chosen from the list of options. The route can be typed in, but to be accepted, it must be a valid route that is in the MEDICATION ROUTES file #51.2.\nCPRS displays unit dose routes based on the following rules:\n1.     If a default medication route is defined in the orderable item file, CPRS displays only the default medication route for the Unit Dose orderable item in the medication route selection list.\n2.     If there is no default medication route defined for the orderable item, CPRS displays all possible medication routes for the dosage form to the provider for selection.\n3.     If there is only one possible medication route, it will be used as the default.\n4.     If a medication route name or its abbreviation is not included in the selection list, a user may type it in.\n \nAlso, medications that are not in the formulary display in the list with the letters \"NF\"  after the name or synonym, which is also displayed. CPRS checks for non-formulary dosages (e.g., the VA formulary may not have a 2.5 MG pill, but it may have a 5.0 MG pill) and for non-formulary orderable items (e.g., the VA may not carry a specific kind of allergy medication).\nTo write a new Outpatient Medications order, follow these steps:\n1.     Select the Meds tab and select Action | New Medication...\n-or-\nselect the Orders tab and click the appropriate item under the Write Orders list.

If the user does not enter enough characters to uniquely identify an item, CPRS waits until the user manually selects an item using the mouse or the keyboard.\n \n3.     Select the medication name or quick order name. Once the name is selected, CPRS displays a second dialog to select the items for the rest of the order. In the top field of the second dialog, the generic medication name and the synonym (usually a brand name) are displayed.\nThe lab results for the most recent lab test associated with the selected medication are displayed in the Information field, if an associated lab test was performed within the last 365 days.\nNote:      A CAC or ADPAC will need to set the OR CPRS LAB DISPLAY ENABLED parameter to ON to activate the lab results display at a site.\n \n To view associated lab results for Quick Orders, a TIU OBJECT must be inserted into the Quick Order. For more information, refer to the Text Integration Utility (TIU) Clinical Coordinator & User Manual. This functionality will work for generalized Quick Orders only (orders assigned to Order Menus). It is not currently implemented for personal Quick Orders.\n \nThe lab results functionality will not work properly for multi-divisional facilities or any sites that use different lab test names at different sites, as only one lab test name can be associated with each drug. To successfully implement this functionality, all facilities/divisions that share a VistA system must use the same name for each monitored lab test.\nNote:      If the selected medication is a controlled substance that requires the signature of a provider with a DEA or VA number, the DEA# Required dialog will appear.

This can help the user decide what additive frequency to select.\nIf Pharmacy did not place anything in that field, it was the same as putting All Bags, but the field will not read All Bags. Additionally, the pharmacist could have entered a value that is acceptable in Pharmacy, but not in CPRS, such as \"second bag\".\nIf the value was accepted before, it will come into the dialog and will display, but it may not be accepted.\nThe only acceptable values for Additive Frequency in CPRS are 1 Bag/Day, All Bags, or See Comments. And if the user put See Comments, there must be something entered in the Comments box.\n \nRelated topics\nViewing Medications\nOrdering Infusions\nPlacing Continuous Infusion Orders\nPlacing Intermittent Infusion Orders\nSorting the Medications View\nOrdering Inpatient Medications (Simple Dose)\nOrdering Inpatient Medications (Complex Dose)\nOrdering Outpatient Medications (Simple Dose)\nOrdering Outpatient Medications (Complex Dose)\nChange Medication Order\nDiscontinue Medication Order\nHold Medication Order\nRenew Medication Order\nOther Medication Actions (popup menu)\n\n\n","Path::contents/Ordering_Regular_Diet_Orders.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Regular_Diet_Orders.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"image/CPRS0029.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Ordering_Regular_Diet_Orders.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/image/CPRS0029.gif"},{"origLink":"Tubefeeding_Diet_Order.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Regular_Diet_Orders.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Tubefeeding_Diet_Order.htm"},{"origLink":"Ordering_Early___Late_Tray_Diet_Order.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Regular_Diet_Orders.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Ordering_Early___Late_Tray_Diet_Order.htm"},{"origLink":"Isolations___Precautions_Order.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Regular_Diet_Orders.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Isolations___Precautions_Order.htm"},{"origLink":"Additional_Diet_Order.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Regular_Diet_Orders.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Additional_Diet_Order.htm"},{"origLink":"How_to_Write_Orders.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Ordering_Regular_Diet_Orders.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/How_to_Write_Orders.htm"}],"Path::contents/Ordering_Regular_Diet_Orders.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Regular_Diet_Orders.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Regular_Diet_Orders.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Regular_Diet_Orders.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Regular_Diet_Orders.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Regular_Diet_Orders.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Regular_Diet_Orders.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Ordering_Regular_Diet_Orders.htm::Title":"Ordering_Regular Diet Orders","Path::contents/Ordering_Regular_Diet_Orders.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Diets,Diets:regular diet orders,Orders,Orders:regular diet orders","Path::contents/Ordering_Regular_Diet_Orders.htm::InnerText":"\nRegular Diet Orders\nTo place a regular diet order, follow these steps:\n1.     Select the Orders tab.\n2.     Select the active orders view from the View Orders pane\n-or-\nselect View | Active Orders (includes pending, recent activity).\n \n3.     Select Diet in the Write Orders list box.\n4.     If there is a conflict, ensure that the order you are entering will not create a problem with a current or delayed diet order.\nThe Diet Order dialog will appear.\nNote:     The diet order may be labeled differently or may not be available from your Write Orders field.\nNote:      The encounter information dialog may appear before the Diet Order dialog if you have not entered encounter information.

Many sites have customized the items in the Write Orders pane. Check with your CAC (or the person who manages information resources at your site) if you have trouble locating the Clinic Medications item.\nNote:  The following prompts will be slightly different based on the patient’s location. You will be asked to verify that you want to write Clinic Medications and to ensure that the encounter location is a clinic location.\n\nIf prompted, enter the appropriate clinic for the encounter information. This will generally happen with an outpatient.\n \nYou can use an existing appointment if one exists or create a new one. To use Clinic Medications, you must enter a location that was previously defined clinic. If you chose a clinic location, you will see this dialog.\n\nThis dialog is to ensure that the user knows they are about to enter Clinic Medications.\n \n\nTo continue ordering Clinic Medications, select Yes and continue to the next step. To stop the Clinic Medications process, choose No.\n(Conditional) If the patient’s current location is not a clinic, you will be asked if you want to change the patient’s location.\nIn the Clinic Medications dialog, locate the medication name or quick order name in the list box by typing characters in the Medication field.\nNote:  CPRS now only auto-selects (highlights in blue and places that entry in the field) a medication, dosage, route, or schedule if the user types enough characters to uniquely identify an item in the list. If the user does not enter enough characters to uniquely identify an item, CPRS waits until the user manually selects an item using the mouse or the keyboard.\n \n\nSelect the quick order or medication name using the mouse or keyboard.\nOnce the name is selected, CPRS displays a second dialog to select the items for the rest of the order. In the top field of the second dialog, the generic medication name and the synonym (usually a brand name) are displayed.\nNote:  If the selected medication is a controlled substance that requires the signature of a provider with a DEA or VA number, the DEA# Required dialog appears. CPRS allows orders for controlled substances only when selected providers are able to sign the orders. You may need to exit the Medication Order dialog, change the provider selection, and then reenter the dialog.\n\nYou must have a DEA# or VA# to order certain medications\n \n\nSelect the Complex tab.\nNote:  After you begin a complex dose medication order, you must remain on the Complex tab until you finish the order. If you switch to the Dosage tab, CPRS clears all complex dosages and you will be forced to start again.\n \n\nSelect the Dosage field and select the appropriate dosage.\nThe dosage may not begin with a decimal, for example .5; it must begin with a numerical value, 0.5 for example. Also, the character “^” may not be entered in the Dosage field. (The associated cost is displayed to the right of the dosage.)\nNote:   CPRS now only auto-selects (highlights in blue and places that entry in the field) a medication, dosage, route, or schedule if the user types enough characters to uniquely identify an item in the list. If the user does not enter enough characters to uniquely identify an item, CPRS waits until the user manually selects an item using the mouse or the keyboard.\n \n\n\nEnter a Route by either selecting one from the list or typing in a valid route.\nWhen the user selects a regular schedule that does not have PRN, the administration times may display in the Schedule column. The administration times will display if they have been defined for the ward or if there is a default.\n \n\nIf you selected an existing schedule, skip to step 13. If you selected OTHER, CPRS displays the Order with Schedule ‘OTHER’ dialog. Take the following steps:\n\nSelect one or more checkboxes by the appropriate days of the week.\nIf the schedule requires specific administration times skip to steps c and d. To select a schedule from the list, highlight the schedule and select Add.\nNote:      Users can assign either a schedule from the list or specific administration times, but not both. If launched from the Complex tab, the Day-of-Week Schedule builder does not display one-time schedules in the schedule list. Also, because the user is specifying days of the week and a schedule, the list will contain only schedules less than 24 hours (for example, Q36H will not be in the list).\n \n\n\nTo use a specific administration time, select the hour and minutes (if the user only selects the hour, the minutes will default to zero) and select Add.\n\n\nRepeat step c until you have entered all required administration times\nWarning:      The administration times in the Schedule field apply to each day of the week that is listed, such as TU-TH-SA@0800-2000, for example. To create a schedule such as TU@0800 TH@2000, users would have to enter two separate orders using the complex medication order dialog. Also, users may not enter a schedule that only has administration times and PRN but no days.\n\n\nIf you make a mistake while selecting an administration time or schedule, do one of the following to remove it:\n\nFor a single administration time, highlight the hour and minutes in the Set Administration Time fields and select Remove (so to remove 08:00, you would have to select that time in the Set Administration Time fields not in the Schedule text box.)\nTo remove the schedule, highlight the schedule and select Remove.\nTo remove the entire schedule and begin again with step a, select Reset.\n\n\n\nReview the Schedule field.\n\n\nWhen you have the correct schedule, select OK.\n\nThe Order with Schedule ‘OTHER’ dialog allows you to enter a customized day-of-week and/or administration-time schedule. The user can enter specific administration times or select a schedule from the available list.\n \n\n\n\n\nSelect PRN if necessary.\nPRN will display in the schedule field if the PRN checkbox is checked or if the schedule is defined in the Pharmacy files as a PRN schedule.\n \n\n\n(Optional) Enter a Comment if desire by moving the cursor to the field and typing the comment.\n\n\nThe date and time that the patient is scheduled to receive the first dose of the medication appears under the Comments field. (For example, CPRS cannot show an expected first dose for “on call” or schedules with PRN. On the complex tab, it will not try to determine an expected first dose after a THEN because the first item must be completed.) If you want the patient to receive an additional dose now, check the Give additional dose now check box. CPRS displays a warning box such as the one shown below\n\nThis graphic shows the warning that ordering providers receive if they select the Give additional dose now check box. The warning makes it clear that CPRS is creating two orders with different schedules.\n  Note:    Make sure that you are careful about using give-additional-dose-now functionality. When you click the check box, CPRS creates two new orders and sends it to Inpatient Medications. Make sure the “Give additional dose now” and the regular order with the original schedule you entered do not overmedicate the patient. “Give additional dose now” is not available for ONCE, ONE-TIME, or NOW orders. It is also not available for delayed orders.\n\n\nCheck the warning message to ensure that the orders you created are what you expected. If the orders are acceptable, select OK. If not, select Cancel to clear the Give additional dose now check box.\n\n\nSelect Accept Order.\nNote:   If you do not complete the mandatory items or if the information is incorrect, CPRS sends a message telling you that the information is incorrect and showing you the correct type of response\n \n\n\n(Conditional) If the medication ordered may be contraindicated because of allergies, drug interactions, or duplicate orders, CPRS will display the Order Check window. Carefully review all order checks and decide if the medication should be ordered. Do one of the following:\n\nTo proceed, select Accept Order.\nTo stop the ordering process and return to the dialog, Cancel Order.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEnter another medication or\n-or-\nselect Quit.\n \n\n\nWhen you select Quit, if the patient is in inpatient, CPRS changes the patient’s location back to where the patient was before changing to the clinic.\n\n\n \nRelated topics\nClinic Medications (Overview)\nOrdering Complex Clinic Medications\nSorting the Medications View\nChanging or Copying Clinic Orders\n\n\n","Path::contents/Patient_Lists.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Patient_Lists.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Setting_a_Default_Patient_List.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Patient_Lists.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Setting_a_Default_Patient_List.htm"}],"Path::contents/Patient_Lists.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Patient_Lists.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Patient_Lists.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Patient_Lists.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Patient_Lists.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Patient_Lists.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Patient_Lists.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Patient_Lists.htm::Title":"Patient Lists","Path::contents/Patient_Lists.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"list,Patient,Patient:lists","Path::contents/Patient_Lists.htm::InnerText":"\nPatient Lists\nYou or your clinical coordinator can create patient or team lists that simplify tasks such as reviewing patient charts, ordering, and signing orders and notes.

For example, you can select the Patient Identification box (or button) to get more information about the patient\n    . You can select on a Visit to see details. For example, a patient could have Zantac listed in the Allergies/Adverse Reactions dialog. By selecting it, you bring up a details screen that contains information, such as the causative agent, signs and symptom\n    s\n    , originator, dates, etc.\n  \n  \n    Select a tab at the bottom of the screen to go to that section of the patient chart.\n  \n   \n  \n    Related Topics\n  \n  \n      Menu bar\n    \n  \n      Patient Information Box\n    \n  \n      CPRS Tabs\n    \n  \n      Pro\n      vider Box\n    \n  Patient Postings\n  Active Medications Display\n  Cover Sheet Customization\n   \n   \n\n","Path::contents/Patient_Data_Objects.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Patient_Data_Objects.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"}],"Path::contents/Patient_Data_Objects.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Patient_Data_Objects.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Patient_Data_Objects.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Patient_Data_Objects.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Patient_Data_Objects.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Patient_Data_Objects.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Patient_Data_Objects.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Patient_Data_Objects.htm::Title":"Patient Data Objects","Path::contents/Patient_Data_Objects.htm::InnerText":"\nPatient Data Objects\nPatient Data Objects are items of information from a patient's record that can be called and inserted into notes, consults and discharge summaries through templates.

Flags","Path::contents/Patient_Record_Flags__Overview.htm::InnerText":"\nPatient Record Flags: Overview\nPatient Record Flags (PRF) are advisories that authorized users place on a patient's chart to improve employee safety and the efficient delivery of health care. Each advisory or flag includes a narrative that describes the reason for the flag and may include some suggested actions for users to take when they encounter the patient. Other information displayed to the user includes the Flag Type, Flag Category, Assignment Status, Initial Assignment Date, Approved by, Next Review Date, Owner Site, and Originating Site. When assigning a flag, authorized users must write a progress note that clinically justifies each flag action.\nFlags are defined in the PRF List Manager software either through a patch or by an authorized user. Once the flag definition exists, authorized users can use the following actions in the PRF software to assign and maintain the flag on a specific patient's record: new assignment, continue, inactivate, mark as entered in error, and reactivate.\nTo make flags widely available to VHA employees who interact with patients, Patient Record Flags are tied to the patient look-up. Whenever a user looks up a patient, the software checks to see if the patient's record has been flagged, and if a flag exists, the software displays the list of flag names.\nTo ensure that users notice them, CPRS uses a Patient Record Flags pop-up box. After a user selects a patient with an active flag assignment, CPRS pops up a dialog containing all flags for the patient. Users can review the flags or close the box. The rest of the patient record does not load until the user closes the PRF pop-up box. Once the rest of the record is loaded, users can view flags at any time using the Flag button or the Cover Sheet list of PRF displayed on the upper right of the Cover Sheet under Patient Record Flags.\nSites can help users notice the flags by using Patient Record Flags judiciously. Overusing these flags could make them cumbersome to users who might therefore choose to ignore them. Ignoring flags could put employees, other patients, and the health care environment at risk.\nTo avoid this situation, before placing a flag on a patient's record, sites must have in place a system for deciding when a flag is appropriate and when it will be reviewed. Sites should also have policies about how to handle questions about flags. To give sites some direction about implementing Patient Record Flags, VHA DIRECTIVE 2010-053, dated December 3, 2010, titled: Patient Record Flags has been issued.\n \nCategory I and Category II Flags\nPatient Record Flags are divided into types: Category I (national) and Category II (local). Category I Patient Record Flags are the most critical and are transmitted to all facilities, ensuring that these flags are universally available. Category II Patient Record Flags are local only, belonging only to the site that created them; they are not shared between sites.\n \nCategory I or National Flags\nCurrently, the only Category I Patient Record Flag is a Behavioral flag for violent or potentially violent patients. The Office of Information created this flag to help VHA properly protect its employees and maintain a safe environment for health care. The Office of Information defines and distributes Category I flags through national patches and the definition of the flag cannot be edited by local sites.\nEach Category I flag assignment to a specific patient's record is owned by a single facility. The facility that placed the Category I flag on the patient's record would normally own and maintain the flag. The site that owns the Category I flag is the only site that can:\n·      review whether to remove or continue the flag\n·      edit the flag\n·      inactivate the flag\n·      reactivate the flag\n·      mark the flag as entered in error\n·      change ownership of the flag\n·      enter a Patient Record Flag Category I progress note for the flag\n \nHowever, ownership of a Category I flag assignment can be transferred. If a patient received the majority of care at a different VA facility than the one that assigned the flag, the site giving the majority of care could request that ownership of the flag be transferred to the that site. The owning site could then change the ownership to the second site through the PRF software in List Manager.\n \nCategory II or Local Flags\nCategory II flags are local. Each site can create and maintain its own set of local flags that are not transmitted to other sites. However, the purpose of Category II flags is similar to Category I--to provide important patient information to health care providers. For example, a site could create a Patient Record Flags Cat II -  Diabetes flag or a Category II Infectious Disease flag.\nIn VHA DIRECTIVE 2010-053, dated December 3, 2010, titled: Patient Record Flags, VHA advised sites to create and use Patient Record Flags sparingly so that users will notice flags and pay careful attention to them. Creating a large number of flags for many different reasons might lessen the impact of flags and cause staff to miss important information. Both Category I flags and Category II flags require a progress note to document the reason for placing a flag on the patient's record.\n \nCreating, Assigning, and Maintaining PRF\nSome sites may have two different groups of users who work with Patient Record Flags: administrative users who create, maintain, and assign flags and the clinical users that document why the flag was placed on the patient's record. Authorized users can define Category II flags and edit their definitions. They assign and maintain the flag on a patient's record using the assignment actions in the PRF software through the List Manager interface: new assignment, continue, inactivate, mark as entered in error, and reactivate. (Additional documentation for PRF creation, assignment, and maintenance is available in the Patient Record Flags User Guide.)\n \nDocumenting PRF\nWith CPRS GUI v.26, each Patient Record Flag action (new assignment, continue, inactivate, reactivate, or mark as entered in error) must have a linked progress note that clinically justifies any action taken. Previously, each flag needed to have a progress note, but there was no link between the note and the flag action. Now when the user writes a PRF progress note, the user must link the note to a flag action. The note might also contain references to supporting documentation.\nIn each flag definition, the user must select the previously created PRF progress note title that will document the reasons for any flag action. This is referred to as associating a progress note title with a PRF. Before a title can be associated with a PRF, the title must be created either by a patch for a national flag or by someone at the site for a local flag.\nFor example, if a user were defining a Wandering flag in the PRF List Manager software, someone at the site must have already used TIU to create the appropriate note title in the correct document class. Then, the user defining the flag would associate a title such as, Patient Record Flag Category II -  Risk, Wandering, by selecting that title from the list of available PRF progress note titles.\nOnce the flag and the progress note title are associated, when the user writing a new progress note selects a PRF progress note title, CPRS displays the flag actions on the selected patient and whether each action has been linked to PRF progress note (Yes or No). For the new PRF note, the user then selects the available flag action to create the link between the note and the flag action.\nNote:      There is a one-to-one correspondence between flag actions and progress notes. Each PRF action for a patient can only be linked to one progress note; each progress note can only be linked to one flag action.\n \nPrerequisites to Writing PRF Progress Notes\nBefore users can write progress notes that document PRF, PRF progress note titles must be set up correctly. Each PRF progress note title must be associated with a specific flag definition, and users must be assigned to the appropriate user classes to write specific kinds of notes. Also, someone must have assigned the flag to the patient.\nFor users to write a progress note and correctly link the note to a flag action, sites must complete the following set up:\n·      To write a PRF note for a category I flag, the user must belong to the DGPF PATIENT RECORD FLAG MGR user class. Each site will be responsible for populating this user class.\n·      Because Category II Patient Record Flags are local, each site must determine if the site will create a user class and business rules to govern which users can write Category II PRF progress notes.\n·      The PRF note titles should follow the naming conventions described in the directive and be descriptive enough that users can tell which note title corresponds to which flag.\n·      The flag definition must contain the progress note title that documents actions for that flag--each PRF note title can only be associated with one flag.\n·      Category II PRF progress note titles must be in the Patient Record Flag Cat II document class under the Progress Notes document class to allow users to associate them with a PRF Category II definition. If the titles are not in this document class, they will not display when the user attempts to associate the title with a PRF Category II flag nor will CPRS get the information about which flags actions are linked. Progress note titles for Category I patient record flags are defined and associated by national patch.\n \nPRF Note Titles\nCurrently, there is only one Category I flag: Behavioral. The Progress Note title for documenting this flag is \"Patient Record Flag Category I\".\nTo help sites that will be creating local Category II flags, four partially customizable Progress Note titles have been distributed:\n·      Patient Record Flag Category II - Risk, Fall\n·      Patient Record Flag Category II - Risk, Wandering\n·      Patient Record Flag Category II - Research Study\n·      Patient Record Flag Category II - Infectious Disease\n \nClinical Application Coordinators (CACs) can customize these titles by changing the text after the dash using TIU utilities. For example, the first title could be changed from \"Patient Record Flag Category II - Risk, Fall\" to \"Patient Record Flag Category II - Behavioral, Drug Seeking\" or other titles sites create.\nCACs can also create their own titles, but the title must follow the naming convention \"Patient Record Flag Category I -  other text\" where other text is the text specific to the local note title.\n \n \nLinking PRF Notes to Flag Actions\nIn the CPRS GUI, users must link a PRF progress note to a flag action when the user writes a PRF note. This linking can also be done through the List Manager interface using TIU options. In the CPRS GUI's Progress Note Properties dialog, when a user selects a Patient Record Flag progress note title, CPRS displays a list of flag actions to which the note can be linked at the bottom of the dialog. This list shows all the actions for the flag and whether each action has been linked.\nFor progress note titles that document the justification for a patient record flag, users will be able to link the progress note to the specific flag action they are documenting. The example shown here is of a Category I PRF progress note and the Continue action to which the user would choose to link.\nNote:      For PRF notes, users must select a flag action to link the note to before they can write the note--the same way users link a note with a consult. CPRS will not allow the user to write the note unless an unused flag action is selected. If the user does not select a flag action, CPRS displays a dialog that states, \"Notes of this title require the selection of a patient record flag action\".\n \nWhen the user select a PRF progress note title, CPRS displays this list of note actions only if sites have done the correct set up as described earlier. The user must then pick the action (new assignment, inactivate, reactivate, continue, or entered in error) that the note is documenting.\nIf a user is viewing a note and wants to see to which PRF action the note is linked, the user can select View | Details on the Notes tab. The details include the flag name, the date, and the action that was linked.\nIf a user writing a new progress note chooses a PRF progress note but CPRS does not display any flag actions for linking, one of the following has probably occurred:\n·      The flag has not been assigned to this patient yet.\n·      The user has selected the wrong progress note title for the flag.\n·      If it is a Category I flag, the site may not own the flag.\n \nMarking PRF as Entered in Error\nMarking PRF as entered in error terminates the flag's display in the patient's record. However, if there was a progress note linked to the flag, the progress note is still in the patient's record. If the flag was entered in error, an authorized TIU user should retract or retract and reassign the linked progress note.\nNote:      Users should be aware that although the flag does not display, a history of this flag is kept in the Patient Record Flag software and users can reactivate the flag. To prevent users from entering notes on previous, inaccurate PRF actions, all previous PRF actions are hidden when a flag is marked as entered in error.\n \nRelated topics\nViewing Patient Record Flags\n \n\n\n","Path::contents/Patients_on_personal_list.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/cprswt.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Patients_on_personal_list.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/cprswt.css"}],"Path::contents/Patients_on_personal_list.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Patients_on_personal_list.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Patients_on_personal_list.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Patients_on_personal_list.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Patients_on_personal_list.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Patients_on_personal_list.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Patients_on_personal_list.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Patients_on_personal_list.htm::Title":"Patients on personal list","Path::contents/Patients_on_personal_list.htm::InnerText":"\nRemove patients to your personal list by selecting patients and using the Remove or Remove All buttons.

Treatment factors, SNOMED CT codes, and ICD-9-CM codes display right after the problem text. If they have been specified by the provider, ICD-10-CM codes can be seen in the detailed display.\n \nCoding Systems Used to Represent Problems\nProblems in CPRS are represented using two systems: Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) codes and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes. SNOMED CT terminology is the designated national standard for Problem List for clinically expressing problems and to support interoperability and data exchange within VA, DoD, and external partners. ICD-10-CM codes are primarily used for reimbursement purposes. Previously, only ICD codes were used to define problems. SNOMED CT should help providers better define problems, while also mapping to ICD codes in the background.\n \nDepending on the method for documenting a problem, the problem represented in SNOMED CT may or may not be linked to an ICD-10-CM code(s). If the user selects a problem from the National Problem Selection List, the problem will be linked to ICD-10-CM code(s). If the user selects a problem from within the Lexicon Utility, the problem will be linked to an R69 code (an unspecified problem).\n \nUsing Problems for Encounter Information\nThe Problem List application passes all patients’ problems to the Encounter Form. These problems can be viewed under the Problem List Item section of the Diagnosis tab and may be utilized for Encounter check out.   However, if the problem is linked to an inactive code or represented in ICD-9-CM, the system requires the user to update the problem. Updates may require the user to link the problem to an active SNOMED CT or ICD-10-CM code.\n \nRelated Topics\nAdding a Problem\nAnnotating a Problem\nChanging a Problem\nCustomizing the Problems List\nMaking a Problem Inactive\nRemoving a Problem\nVerifying a Problem\n \n\n\n","Path::contents/Printing_a_Report.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Printing_a_Report.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Printing_from_CPRS.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Printing_a_Report.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Printing_from_CPRS.htm"}],"Path::contents/Printing_a_Report.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Printing_a_Report.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Printing_a_Report.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Printing_a_Report.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Printing_a_Report.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Printing_a_Report.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Printing_a_Report.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Printing_a_Report.htm::Title":"Printing a Report","Path::contents/Printing_a_Report.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Print,Print:printing a report (table view),Read-only,Reports,Reports:printing a report","Path::contents/Printing_a_Report.htm::InnerText":"\nPrinting a Report\nTo print a report, follow these steps:\n1.     From the Reports tab, select the report you would like to print.\n2.     If the report is in text format, right click on the text of the report\n-or-\nif the report is in table format, click on the row that contains the data you would like to print (to select more than one row, press and hold either the Shift or Control key).

In addition, you can cut and paste from lab results, the Problem List, or other online information, to complete your Notes.\nOutpatient notes must be associated with a Visit (Encounter).

If you do not have a default title when you begin a new document, you will be prompted for specific information before entering note text.\nWhen you start a new document, CPRS must have a document title, date, and author. Depending on the type of document you select, you may also have to enter an expected cosigner or an associated consult.\nBy getting this information when you begin the document, CPRS can then auto-save your document as you create it to minimize data lost if your system crashes or exits prematurely.\nThe auto-save interval is determined by a CPRS parameter.\n \nChanging the Document Title, Author, Date\nWith this version of CPRS, you can change the title, author, date, expected cosigner, and other reference information for a document while you are editing the document. In addition, you have the choice to ignore, append, or replace boilerplate text when changing to a document title that has boilerplate text.\n \nImages Associated with a Document\nIf your site uses the CPRS GUI and VistA Imaging, you can have images associated with documents. To view the image, you must have the VistA Imaging Display program on the workstation you are using.\nTo simultaneously view a document and the associated images, you will need to be running both VistA Imaging Display and the CPRS GUI. When you click on a document in CPRS that has an associated image, CPRS will bring up the note text and VistA Imaging Display will display the associated images.\nTo show you which documents have associated images, CPRS displays a small icon next to the document title in the document list. An example is shown in the graphic below.\n\n \nDocument Templates\nIn the Windows version of CPRS, Progress Notes can be created using templates--predefined text that both clinical coordinators and individual users can create and save, to later be entered into a note with a few clicks of the mouse.\nYou can create individual templates, group templates, and dialog templates. And you can organize them into a hierarchical structure using folders. You can also include Patient Data Objects (TIU objects) in your templates.\n \nProgress Notes Created During Reminder Processing\nThe combination of the Windows version of CPRS and the new Clinical Reminders package will add another facet to Progress Note creation. As clinicians use the new reminder functionality to meet Clinical Guidelines, they will be able to quickly click on the appropriate check boxes in dialogs that sites will build to document an encounter, including entering PCE data, placing orders if wanted, and entering predefined text into their Progress Note.\n \nRelated Topics\nViewing Progress Notes\nWriting a New Progress Note\nChanging a Document's Author, Title, Reference, etc.\nDocument Templates (overview)\n \n\n\n","Path::contents/Primary_Care_Information.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Primary_Care_Information.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"image/CPRS0114.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Primary_Care_Information.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/image/CPRS0114.gif"},{"origLink":"image/CPRS0115.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Primary_Care_Information.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/image/CPRS0115.gif"},{"origLink":"image/CPRS0116.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Primary_Care_Information.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/image/CPRS0116.gif"},{"origLink":"image/CPRS0117.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Primary_Care_Information.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/image/CPRS0117.gif"}],"Path::contents/Primary_Care_Information.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Primary_Care_Information.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Primary_Care_Information.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Primary_Care_Information.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Primary_Care_Information.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Primary_Care_Information.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Primary_Care_Information.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Primary_Care_Information.htm::Title":"Primary Care Information","Path::contents/Primary_Care_Information.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"associate provider,mental health:treatment coordinator,MHTC or mental health treatment coordinator,Primary:Primary Care button,Provider:associate,Provider:primary care,Treatment:coordinator for mental health","Path::contents/Primary_Care_Information.htm::InnerText":"\nPrimary Care Information\nImprovements are coming to the display of provider and team information that users see on the Primary Care button and in the detailed display that the user can view by selecting the Primary Care button.

Several items have been added to the available information, such as information from different sites, additional information about the kinds of providers listed, and new labels for teams, etc.\nAll active team information will display regardless of station.\nSome items only display if certain conditions are met. For example, if the patient is not an inpatient, no inpatient information is displayed. If an associate provider is not explicitly assigned to the patient, it will not display. If information is not entered for a team, no team information or labels will display.\n \nLocal versus Remote Sites\nThe detailed display shows whether the information that the user is viewing is local or remote. The detailed display can show both local and remote information at the same time. Sites will display in alphabetical order with all local sites first, then all remote sites, and finally any Non-VA providers that might be entered.\nThe format is to show the word “Local” or “Remote”, then the site name, and then the station number as the example below shows:\nLOCAL – CHEYENNE (442)\nLOCAL – CHEYENNE (442) ||GREELEY CBOC (442GC) [B-03124]\nREMOTE – DC VAMC (999)\nNon-VA\n \nAfter each entry such as those above, the team information will display.

It has a value for some or all of the fields for the specific type of order selected. For example, on an outpatient medication order, the user might define the type of medication, dosage, route, and schedule, quantity, and number of refills. If the user does not define a value for one or more mandatory fields, CPRS will display the dialog for the user to fill in the missing values. Quick orders can be created for many different types of orders. There are two types of quick orders: personal and shared.\nPersonal Quick Orders\nPersonal quick orders are created when a user fills out the order dialog, but before the user accepts the order, the user can select Options | Save as Quick Order... and give the quick order a name. CPRS saves the order, and it can then be used from that same dialog where it was created by the user that created it. Personal quick orders display at the top of the list of orders and are separated from the rest of the orders by a line.\nFor example, if a user creates a lab order and then saves it as a personal quick order, the user will give the personal quick order a name and that item will appear at the top of the lab order dialog with any other personal quick orders, followed by a line and then the full list of lab orders the next time that user opens the dialog.\nTo create a personal quick order, use these steps:\n1.     Fill out an order dialog for a medication, lab, or other order that you frequently place, but DO NOT select Accept.\n2.     With the order dialog still up, select Options | Save as Quick Order....\n3.     In the Add Quick Orders (type) dialog, where type is the package or type of order, such as Labs, Outpatient meds, etc., enter a name for the quick order and select OK.\nNote:      You cannot save personal quick orders with the same name, even if the capitalization is different.\n \nTo manage personal quick orders, use these steps:\n1.     Open the appropriate ordering dialog (Outpatient Meds, Inpatient Meds, Infusions, Labs, etc.).\n2.     Select Options | Edit Common List....\n3.     To rename a personal quick order, do the following:\na)     Highlight the personal quick order name.\nb)     Select the Rename button.\nc)     In the Rename dialog, type the new name for the personal quick order and select OK.\nd)     Repeat steps a-c if needed to rename additional orders.\n \n4.     To change the position of a personal quick order in the list, do the following:\na)     Highlight the personal quick order name.\nb)     Use the arrow buttons to the left of the name list to move the name up or down to the chosen position.\nc)     Repeat steps a and b if needed to arrange the list to your preference.\n \n5.     To delete a quick order, do the following:\na)     Highlight the personal quick order to be deleted.\nb)     Select the Delete button.\nc)     Repeat steps a and b if needed to delete additional personal quick orders.\n \n6.     When finished managing the personal quick order list, select OK.\n \nSite-Wide Quick Orders\nMany sites have created an entire set of Quick Orders that they use. IRM staff at each site can customize the Write Orders list box with a selection that will bring up the Quick Order menus they have created. This item might be called Assign New Orders, Common Orders, or whatever the site deems appropriate. When a clinician clicks on this item, CPRS brings up the menu containing Quick Orders and other orders defined by the site. Sites can set up orderables to be Quick Orders. See your clinical coordinator if you have items you wish to have set up as sitewide Quick Orders.\nShared quick orders are created in VistA by someone like a Clinical Applications Coordinator (CAC). These quick orders can be made available to all CPRS users by placing them on order menus, and can be used in order sets.\n \nRelated topics\nPlacing a Quick Order\n \n\n\n","Path::contents/Provider_Selection_Critieria_for_Similar_Names.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Provider_Selection_Critieria_for_Similar_Names.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"}],"Path::contents/Provider_Selection_Critieria_for_Similar_Names.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Provider_Selection_Critieria_for_Similar_Names.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Provider_Selection_Critieria_for_Similar_Names.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Provider_Selection_Critieria_for_Similar_Names.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Provider_Selection_Critieria_for_Similar_Names.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Provider_Selection_Critieria_for_Similar_Names.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Provider_Selection_Critieria_for_Similar_Names.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Provider_Selection_Critieria_for_Similar_Names.htm::Title":"Provider Selection Critieria for Similar Names","Path::contents/Provider_Selection_Critieria_for_Similar_Names.htm::InnerText":"\nTo help you distinguish between providers, CPRS displays their titles (if available).

When you are processing notifications, you can also renew a notification, which ensures that you will see the notification again the next time you log in, or forward the notification to one or more users.\nNote:      Sometimes CPRS will display an alert that belongs to a sensitive record--one that the user cannot view. CPRS blocks access to sensitive records when the user is processing notifications and alerts. If the alert that cannot be viewed is the first one to be processed, CPRS will give an error message and return to the Patient Selection screen. If the sensitive record is for an alert other than the first, CPRS will process the alerts until it gets to the sensitive record and will then return the user to the Patient Selection screen. Then the user can reselect alerts, excluding the one to the sensitive record, and continue processing.\n \nTo process notifications, use these steps:\n1.     Bring up the Patient Selection screen, either by launching CPRS or if you are already running CPRS, selecting File | Select New Patient.\n2.     Decide which notifications to process.\no     To process all information notifications (items preceded by an I.), click Process Info.\no     To process all notifications, click Process All.\no     To process specific notifications, highlight one or more notifications, and then click Process.

To select multiple items that are not in a row, click one, hold down the Control key, and click the other specific notifications.\n \n3.     Process the notification by completing the necessary task, such as signing an overdue order or viewing information notifications.\nNote:  For AudioRenewal requests that cannot be automatically renewed for some reason, CPRS has a new notification. The NonRenewable RX Request for notification is an action alert that takes the user to the orders tab. The user can then use the Copy to New Order feature (because the order cannot be renewed) if they want to continue the medication therapy for the patient. If providers receive an alert for a patient they no longer see, they can Forward the alert to the appropriate provider. Who receives the alert is based on the set up for the alert. Contact your CAC or similar personnel if you are repeatedly getting alerts for the wrong patients.\n4.     If you want to renew or forward this notification to someone else, right-click the Next button and select either Renew or Forward as shown in the graphic below. If you selected Forward, proceed to step 5.

If these patches have been installed and the proper parameters have been set, you can access remote data generated at other VA and Department of Defense (DOD) facilities.\n \n\nText on the Remote Data and VistaWeb buttons\n \nThe CPRS user now has two choices for viewing remote data. One is the traditional Remote Data View (which has been streamlined), the other is VistAWeb. Each system has its advantages.\nNote:       The Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV) is a new way to view remote data and will eventually replace VistaWeb. JLV is available now. Some sites may not switch to JLV until VistAWeb is decommissioned, while others may choose to transition sooner. This transition should be made in collaboration with local Informatics staff and the JLV team. When the change occurs, the existing VistaWeb button can be renamed and redirected to take the user to the JLV.\nThe rest of this section follows Remote Data Views. If you want to use VistAWeb, documentation is available on the VistAWeb VA intranet page at http://domaindomain.ext/vistaweb\nIf the patient has remote data, the VistaWeb button text changes color to blue. If the user selects the VistaWeb button, the button changes appearance to look as if it is depressed. It will keep that appearance until the user selects a new patient.\nWhen VistaWeb is launched by CPRS Context Management is maintained. This means that VistAWeb will change patients whenever the user selects a new patient in CPRS.\n \nHow Do I Know a Patient Has Remote Medical Data?\nAs part of opening a patient record, CPRS checks in the Treating Specialty file to see if the selected patient visited other facilities. If the patient has remote data, the words on the Remote Data button turn blue. If there is no remote data for the selected patient, the letters are gray and the button unavailable.\nIf the user selects the Remote Data button with the blue text indicating that there is remote data, CPRS displays a list of sites that tells the user where and when the patient has been seen.\nWhat Does the List of Sites Represent?\nIf you select on the Remote Data button, a drop-down list appears with the name(s) of sites where the patient has been seen. This list is based on either:\n·      Sites that have been specifically designated for your facility to access. These sites are assigned in a parameter that your Clinical Applications Coordinator (CAC) can set up.\n·      All VA sites where the patient has been seen and any Department of Defense remote data if it is available.\n \nWhat Kind of Data Can I View?\nCurrently with CPRS, you can view some lab and health summary components. There are limitations to what you can view.\n·      You can view any lab results that do not require input other than a date range.\n·      All reports listed on the Reports tab unless they are labeled \"local only\"\n·      You can view health summary components that have the same name on both the local and the remote site. You can therefore exchange national Health Summaries, but locally defined components may not be available unless the other site also has a component with the same name.\n·      If it is available, CPRS can also show some Department of Defense remote data.\n \nHow Will the Remote Data Be Viewed?\nViewing remote data is a two-step process. First, you select which remote sites you want to see data from, and then you select the specific information you want to view, such as lab tests or Health Summary components.\nOn the Reports tab, each site you select will have a separate tab for its data. As an example, you would might see five tabs on the Reports tab: Local, Department of Defense, Devcur, Loma Linda, Ca., and Office of Information.\nYou would then select the reports you want to view and a date range (if necessary). After this, CPRS will attempt to retrieve those reports if they are available on the remote sites. You would then click on each Treatment Facility's tab to see the report from that site. While CPRS is attempting to retrieve the data, the message \"Transmission in Progress:\" is displayed until the data is retrieved.\n \nRelated topics\nViewing Remote Data\nChoosing RDV or VistaWeb to View Remote Data\n \n\n\n","Path::contents/Remove_a_Comment.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Remove_a_Comment.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"}],"Path::contents/Remove_a_Comment.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Remove_a_Comment.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Remove_a_Comment.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Remove_a_Comment.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Remove_a_Comment.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Remove_a_Comment.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Remove_a_Comment.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Remove_a_Comment.htm::Title":"Remove a Comment","Path::contents/Remove_a_Comment.htm::InnerText":"\nRemoving a Comment from a Problem\nTo remove a comment, follow these steps:\n1.     Select on the text of the comment.\n2.     Select Remove comment.\n\n\n","Path::contents/Reminders_Icons.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Reminders_Icons.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"image/CPRS0046.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Reminders_Icons.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/image/CPRS0046.gif"},{"origLink":"image/CPRS0047.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Reminders_Icons.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/image/CPRS0047.gif"},{"origLink":"image/CPRS0048.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Reminders_Icons.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/image/CPRS0048.gif"},{"origLink":"image/CPRS0049.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Reminders_Icons.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/image/CPRS0049.gif"},{"origLink":"image/CPRS0050.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Reminders_Icons.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/image/CPRS0050.gif"},{"origLink":"image/CPRS0051.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Reminders_Icons.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/image/CPRS0051.gif"},{"origLink":"image/CPRS0052_wmf.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Reminders_Icons.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/image/CPRS0052_wmf.gif"}],"Path::contents/Reminders_Icons.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Reminders_Icons.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Reminders_Icons.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Reminders_Icons.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Reminders_Icons.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Reminders_Icons.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Reminders_Icons.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Reminders_Icons.htm::Title":"Reminders Icons","Path::contents/Reminders_Icons.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Read-only","Path::contents/Reminders_Icons.htm::InnerText":"\nReminders Icons\nThe reminders icons tell you if a patient has reminders and whether reminders have been evaluated or are due.

For example, although not part of the normal routine, a particular education topic might be very useful and be placed in Other.\n \n·      Question Mark: A question mark on the Reminders button indicated that the reminders have not yet been evaluated.

The project makes several enhancements involving scheduling appointments, including the ability to create an order in CPRS that is sent to Scheduling so that a clerk can schedule one or more appointments for a patient to return to a clinic for additional visits.\nNote:   The Return to Clinic dialog will only be available to the user if the appropriate VistA Scheduling Enhancements patch (SD*5.3*671) has been installed on your system.\nThe Return to Clinic dialog has several fields that enable the user to specify the details related to the patient returning for one or more appointments:\n\nQuick Orders: This field lists any personal quick orders that the user has already saved for himself or herself. To create Return to Clinic personal quick orders, enter all the necessary data in the Return to Clinic order dialog, but do not select Accept yet. Then, save it as a Personal Quick Order.\nClinic: The clinic the patient should return to\nDate: The date the patient should return to the clinic\nTime Sensitive: Whether the appointment is Time-Sensitive\n\n\nNot Time Sensitive (box unchecked): If the appointment is not time-sensitive, the order will read “on or around”.\nTime Sensitive (box checked): If the appointment is Time Sensitive, the order text will read “no later than”.\n\n\nNumber of Appointments: Providers enter the number of future appointments they would like to request. The number of return appointments is limited to 60.\nInterval in day(s): Note that this field is only available when the number of appointments is greater than 1. Providers can enter the number of days between appointments. For example, a provider may want to request a number of appointments 14 days apart. The maximum interval is 30 days.\nPrerequisites (check all that apply): This item is available only if the site puts items into a parameter where prerequisites are defined. For example, if nothing is put in the parameter, the user will not have any selections in this field. However, if the site puts in labs or radiology, the provider can select as many of those items as apply.\nComments: This is where the user can enter their own comments for the scheduler to see.\nMore Information: This field displays information to the user while they are creating the order. This is information entered by the site, rather than by the provider.\nOrder Sig: This field is created as information is entered into the dialog by the user.\n\n\nTo order a request for return or follow-up appointments, please use these steps:\n\nOn the CPRS Orders tab under the Write Orders pane, select Return to Clinic.\nIn the Return to Clinic dialog, if you have saved a Quick Order that you would like to use, select the down arrow and then select the quick order. If not, proceed to step 3.\nSelect the Clinic field’s drop-down box’s arrow and then the appropriate clinic name. (This is a required field.)\nIn the Date field, select the date. (This is a required field.)\nIf the appointment is time-sensitive, select the Time Sensitive check box. Selecting the Time Sensitive check box will change the order text in the Order Sig from “on or around” to “no later than”.\nIf you want more than one appointment, place the cursor in the Number of Appointments field, enter the number of appointments.\nIn the Interval in day(s) field, enter the number of days between appointments.\nIf the field is active, you can select the Prerequisites field, you can select one or more prerequisites, such as lab work or imaging, that should precede the appointments.\nIn the Comments field, type in any comments that should go with the orders.\nIn the More Information field, additional information displays for the user to see.\nReview the Order Sig to ensure that it is as you need it.\nNote:     If the order is one that the user will reuse frequently, the user can save it as a personal quick order. To save this as a quick order, go to the menu bar and select Options | Save as Personal Quick Order. Then, the order will display in the Quick order field the next time the dialog is opened.\n\nIf the Order Sig is correct, select Accept.\n \nAfter the user signs the order, the order is sent to Scheduling so that a clerk can make the requested appointments.\n\n\nHere is an example of an unsigned Return to Clinic order displayed on the Orders tab. The display shows a Return to Clinic order under the new Service category of Clinic Scheduling.\n\nClinic Scheduling orders can have the following statuses:\n\nUnreleased: The order will have this status before it is signed.\nPending: The order will have this status after it is signed but before being acted upon by the Scheduling package.\nCompleted: The order will have this status after Scheduling has acted up on it.\nDiscontinued: The order will have this status if the order is discontinued in CPRS prior to being acted upon by the Scheduling package.\n\n \nAfter the Clinic Scheduling order is signed, if the user right-clicks on the order, only two items will be available: Discontinue and Change. This is different from medications orders, for example.\nThis capture show the detailed display for a Return to clinic order.\n\n\n\n","Path::contents/Select_Combination_source_by.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/cprswt.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Select_Combination_source_by.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/cprswt.css"}],"Path::contents/Select_Combination_source_by.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Select_Combination_source_by.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Select_Combination_source_by.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Select_Combination_source_by.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Select_Combination_source_by.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Select_Combination_source_by.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Select_Combination_source_by.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Select_Combination_source_by.htm::Title":"Select Combination source by","Path::contents/Select_Combination_source_by.htm::InnerText":"\nSelect the source of your combination list.\n\n\n","Path::contents/Select_Patients_by.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/cprswt.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Select_Patients_by.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/cprswt.css"}],"Path::contents/Select_Patients_by.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Select_Patients_by.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Select_Patients_by.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Select_Patients_by.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Select_Patients_by.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Select_Patients_by.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Select_Patients_by.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Select_Patients_by.htm::Title":"Select Patients by","Path::contents/Select_Patients_by.htm::InnerText":"\nSelect how you wish to add patients to your personal list.\n\n\n","Path::contents/Saving_a_Default_Order_View.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Saving_a_Default_Order_View.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Return_to_Default_Order_View.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Saving_a_Default_Order_View.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Return_to_Default_Order_View.htm"}],"Path::contents/Saving_a_Default_Order_View.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Saving_a_Default_Order_View.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Saving_a_Default_Order_View.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Saving_a_Default_Order_View.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Saving_a_Default_Order_View.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Saving_a_Default_Order_View.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Saving_a_Default_Order_View.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Saving_a_Default_Order_View.htm::Title":"Saving a Default Order View","Path::contents/Saving_a_Default_Order_View.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Default,Default:order view,Orders,Orders:default view","Path::contents/Saving_a_Default_Order_View.htm::InnerText":"\nSaving a Default Order View\nAfter you customize your view of the orders list, you can save the view as your default view.

dialog allows you to simultaneously sign several orders and documents at the same time. The Review/Sign Changes option is on the File menu and brings up a dialog with the items that need a signature from the current ordering session.\nSometimes during the ordering process, the status of a patient changes from outpatient to inpatient or vice versa. This might happen because an outpatient was admitted to the facility, or because an inpatient was sent to a clinic for treatment, or because of using Inpatient Medications for Outpatients (IMO) feature. When written unsigned orders exist and the patient's status changes, the user must indicate which location the orders are associated with.\nTo designate which location written unsigned orders are associated with, the following dialog will appear:\n\nThis dialog asks to which location CPRS should associate the orders that have been placed but not signed.\nThe order location dialog shows the user the two locations the user can choose from, generally an outpatient clinic and an inpatient location. The user the has two basic options:\n·      Associate all of the orders with a single location by selecting the appropriate button above the list of orders. The buttons will read All location where location is the name of the clinic or ward location. In the above screen capture the buttons read All MICU and All Mental Health Clinic.\n·      Individually associate each order with one of the two locations. At the end of each order is a column to select the location for each order.\n \nIf the user is keeping the patient's chart open, such as selecting File | Review / Sign changes... and this dialog appears, the \"Where would you like to continue processing patient data?\" prompt displays enabling the user to choose either the ward location or the clinic location. This prompt does not appear if the user is exiting the chart or switching patients.\n \nTo sign orders and documents with the Review / Sign Changes dialog, follow these steps:\n1.     Do one of the following\no     Select File | Review / Sign Changes.... to sign orders or documents and stay in the current patient record.\no     Choose File | Select New Patient to sign orders or documents and select a new patient.\no     Choose File | Exit to sign orders and documents and exit CPRS.\n \n \n2.     (Conditional) If CPRS displays order checks, review the order checks and take the appropriate action below:\n\nIn this screen capture, CPRS displays several possible conflicts between ordered medications. Users should review each item carefully before completing the order. If an order check is larger than the cell's available space, the user can hover with the mouse to the get the full text or use the arrow keys to highlight the order check if using the keyboard or accessibility product for visually challenged users. Some order checks require an override reason. These order checks are designated by the \"*Order Check requires Reason for Override\" text in red and the order check text in blue.\n \na)    To redo the orders to avoid a possible interaction, select Return to Orders. This will cancel the signature process, but not the order.\nb)    If the orders should not be placed, check the cancel check box in front of the orders that should not be placed and select Cancel Checked Order(s).\nc)     If the possible interactions are not a problem, type a reason for override (required only for critical order checks) select Continue.\nAfter performing step 1 and after addressing any order checks in step 2, one of the Review/Sign Changes dialogs shown below will appear. Each item that requires a signature will have a check box in front of it.\nNote:      All non-controlled substances orders will be checked for signature when the dialog displays. To sign controlled substances orders, the user must check the box for each order individually.\nOne of the following dialogs displays.\n\nFigure A: This is for providers that can sign orders by policy, such as nurses or clerks.\n \n\nFigure B: The Review/Sign changes dialog may have additional elements depending on the nature of the patient. In this case, the provider can sign controlled substances orders and the patient's conditions are not service-connected.\n \n\nFigure C: In this example of the Review/Sign Changes dialog, the provider can sign controlled substance orders, and the patient has either Combat Veteran status or service-connected conditions for which the provider must indicate the orders pertain.\n \n3.     Deselect any items under the All Orders Except Controlled Substance Orders pane that you do not want to sign by clicking the check box to the left of the order or document.\n4.     If the Review / Sign Changes dialog is the simpler dialog, enter your electronic signature code and select Sign. The documents and orders will now be signed.\nIf the Review / Sign Changes dialog resembles Figure B or Figure C and contains question marks, continue to step 5.\n5.     To select Controlled Substance order to sign, place a check mark in the box to the left each Controlled Substance order to sign by clicking in the check box, or tabbing to it and pressing the <Space bar>.\nNote:     When the user checks the box to the left of any Controlled Substance order for signature, the phrase SMART card required displays next to the label Controlled Substance Orders.\n \n\nThis is what the dialog looks like before controlled substance outpatient orders are checked for signature.\n \n\nAfter the controlled substances orders are checked, the text about the \"smart card required\" and the text the provider is acknowledging display.\n \n6.    The blue question marks inside the dialog's check boxes indicate that you need to specify how that order is related to the medical condition in that column. (SC = Service Connected Condition, CV=Combat Veteran, AO=Agent Orange Exposure, IR=Ionizing Radiation Exposure, SWAC=Southwest Asia Conditions, SHD=Shipboard Hazard and Defense, MST=Military Sexual Trauma, and HNC=Head or Neck Cancer). If you place a check in a box, you are indicating that a medication order is related to the condition in that column. If you create an empty box, you are indicating that the medication order is not related to the condition in that column. You must either check or uncheck every box that contains a blue question mark before you can sign the order.\nNote:     Definitions for service connection and treatment factors are available to users by hovering the cursor over the term or using the appropriate keyboard shortcut as shown in the list below:\no     Service connection (SC)        Alt + c\no     Combat Veteran (CV)        Alt + v\no     Agent Orange (AO)         Alt + o\no     Ionizing Radiation (IR)        Alt + r\no     Southwest Asia Conditions (SWAC)       Alt + a\no     Shipboard Hazard and Defense (SHD)      Alt + h\no     Military Sexual Trauma (MST)       Alt + m\no     Head and/or Neck Cancer (HNC)       Alt + n\n \nYou can toggle the check boxes by:\n·      Selecting an individual check box or tabbing to the check box and pressing the spacebar.\nThis will toggle the box between checked and unchecked.\n \n·      To check all check boxes in a column, select the button above the appropriate column.\nThis will toggle all the check boxes in that column.\n \n·      Selecting the All button.\nThis will toggle all the check boxes on the dialog.\n \n7.     If you have not already done so, insert your PIV or smart card.\nNote:      If you do not insert your PIV or smart  card before attempting to sign the selected Controlled Substance orders, you will see the following two dialogs:\n\n\n \n8.     When you have removed all of the question marks from the dialog, enter your electronic signature code (the button will change from Don't Sign to Sign) and click Sign.\n9.    (Conditional) If your PIV card is already set up, you will not see the Digital Signing Setup dialog and you can proceed to step 10. If your PIV or Smart card is not yet linked to your VistA account, you will need to set it up before you can sign outpatient controlled substance medication orders. To set up your PIV or smart card to order outpatient controlled substance orders, select Yes.\n\nYou may then be asked to enter your PIN.\n\nThen, the signature process will proceed.\n \n10.   If the Order Check dialog appears, deal with any problems in the dialog: such as entering a reason for override, cancelling specific orders, etc. When ready, select the Accept Orders button.\n \n11.   When prompted, enter your PIN to sign the Controlled Substance orders and select OK or press <Enter>.\n\nWarning:      Do NOT enter an incorrect PIN five (5) consecutive times! If you enter the incorrect PIN five (5) consecutive times, your card will be until you visit a PIV issuing station.\nIf you enter the incorrect PIN three (3) times, CPRS temporarily locks your PIV card for 15 minutes. Then, it will allow you to try again. However, you only have two (2) more attempts to get the correct PIN. If you get to five (5) consecutive incorrect PIN entries, the PIV card will be locked and you will have to go to a PIV station to unlock the card.\n \nCriteria Used to Determine if the Copay Buttons are Displayed on the Review/Sign Changes Dialog\nThe Review/Sign Changes dialog may contain the Copay buttons (SC = Service Connected Condition, CV=Combat Veteran, AO=Agent Orange Exposure, IR=Ionizing Radiation Exposure, SWAC=Southwest Asia Conditions, SHD=Shipboard Hazard and Defense, MST=Military Sexual Trauma, and HNC=Head or Neck Cancer) if the current patient has outpatient medication orders that need to be signed and certain additional conditions are met. The additional conditions are explained below.\nNote:      The Copay buttons will not appear until after December 31, 2001 and PSO*7*71 has been installed.\nNote:      Previously, CPRS did not display the buttons if a veteran was 50% or more service connected. If Clinical Indicators Data Capture (CIDC) is installed and the user is not enabled for CIDC, the buttons display for outpatient medications regardless of the patient's level of service connection based on the criteria below. The 50% criterion below does not apply with CIDC installed.\n \n·      To qualify for the Combat Veteran (CV) exemption, the veteran must have served in combat operations after the Gulf War or in combat against a hostile force after November 11, 1998. In addition, the condition for which the veteran is treated must be related to that combat, the veteran must have registered as a combat veteran, and be within two years of separation from active military service. Finally, the condition must not be already considered to be service related or that exemption should apply.\nNote:      The Combat Veteran exemption is valid for two years from the date of separation from military service, not the registration date. For example, if a veteran registers for Combat Veteran status 18 months after the date of his or her separation, the veteran would be eligible for Combat Veteran exemption for six months only. For further details, see VHA Directive 2002-049, Combat Veterans Are Eligible for Medical Services for 2-Years after Separation from Military Service Notwithstanding Lack of Evidence for Service Connection. If a patient is a veteran and 50% service connected or greater then the Copay buttons will not be displayed on the Review / Sign Changes dialog.\n·      If a patient is a veteran and 50% service connected or greater, then the Copay buttons will not be displayed on the Review / Sign Changes dialog.\n·      If a patient is a veteran and less than 50% service connected and the patient is exempt from copay then the Copay buttons will not be displayed.\n·      If a patient is a veteran and less than 50% service connected and the patient is not exempt from copay then the Pharmacy package checks to see if the drug specified in the medication order is marked as supply or investigational. If the drug is marked as supply or investigational, the copay buttons will not appear.\nHowever, if the drug specified in the order is not marked as supply or investigational than CPRS checks if the patient has any other exemptions (Service Connected Condition, Agent Orange Exposure, Ionizing Radiation Exposure, Southwest Asia Conditions, Shipboard Hazard and Defense, Military Sexual Trauma, or Head and/or Neck Cancer).

If you select a category, CPRS displays the associated patients in the Patients list box, followed by a line, and then the comprehensive patient list. Your Clinical Coordinator will usually create the lists for the teams, wards, and so on, but you can create personal lists using Tools | Options.\nTo locate a patient name, you can either type in part or all of their name, the social security number, or the first letter of the patient's last name and last four digits of the social security number. When you stop typing, CPRS will use what you entered to search the patient list and bring up that part of the patient list, highlight a possible match, and display the patient's demographic information under the Cancel button.\nTo open a patient record, use these steps:\n1.     If you are just opening CPRS, skip to step 2. Otherwise, select File | Select New Patient....\nNote:      If you have just entered orders or documents that are unsigned, a screen will pop up asking you to review / sign the changes.\n \n2.     In the Patient Selection screen, use one of the following methods to choose a patient:\no     Type the patient's social security number with or without dashes (000-44-4444 or 000444444); or the full social security number with \"P\" as the last character (000-44-4444p, or 000444444p).\no     Type all or part of the patient's last name or the patient's entire name.\no     Type the first letter of the patient's last name and the last four digit of the patient's Social Security number (c4444).\n \nCPRS will try to match what you entered to a patient and highlight that patient. The patient's name and other information will appear below the Cancel button.\nNote:     CPRS now only auto-selects (highlights in blue and places that entry in the field) a patient name if the user types enough characters to uniquely identify a name in the list. If the user does not enter enough characters to uniquely identify an item, CPRS waits until the user explicitly selects an item using the mouse or the keyboard.\n \n3.     Verify that the correct patient is highlighted. If the correct patient is highlighted, select OK. If the correct patient is not highlighted, scroll through to find the correct patient, highlight the name, and then select OK.\nWhen you click OK, CPRS opens to the Cover Sheet (unless you have set this to a different tab, which you can do using Tools | Options).\nYou can also use the radio buttons under the Patient List heading (located on the left-side of the window) to group the patient list according to provider, team, specialty, clinic, or ward. When you select a specific list for a provider, team, specialty, clinic, or ward, CPRS will display the associated patients in the Patients list box, followed by a line, and then the comprehensive patient list. You can then scroll to find the name. Your Clinical Coordinator will usually create the lists for the teams, wards, and so on.\n \nHow CPRS Sorts Names\nVistA software uses a set of characters that include uppercase and lowercase Latin alphabetic characters (A-Z, a-z), numbers (0-9), and other special characters.\nThis is important because of how names are sorted if the user is searching for a partial name. If VistA has stored characters other than the Latin alphabetic and numeric, such as ñ, and the user does a partial search (types in only part of the name, for example), the names may not display in the order the user expects.\nFor example, if you had patients or clinicians with names like Pina, Piña, Piñon, Pine, Pinto, Pitcher, Pitt, Pixon, and Pizzelo, and the Piña and Piñon were entered with an ñ. If the user typed in \"pi\" as what CPRS should search for, CPRS would display the names as shown below:\nPina\nPine\nPinto\nPitcher\nPitt\nPixon\nPizzelo\nPiña\nPiñon\n \nNote that Piña is after Pizzelo. This is because VistA sorts these characters based on their numeric values in the character set VistA uses. For example, in that table, the number for lowercase \"a\" might be 97, \"z\" might be 122, and \"ñ\" might be 241. Characters other than the uppercase and lowercase Latin alphabetic characters and numbers, such as ñ or the tilde (~) will display wherever their numeric equivalent falls, which is generally after z.\n \nRelated Topics\nClosing a Patient Record\nSetting a Default Patient List\nPatient Lists\nCover

sign them all simultaneously. However, you cannot sign documents with this command.\nSometimes during the ordering process, the status of a patient changes from outpatient to inpatient or vice versa. This might happen because an outpatient was admitted to the facility, or because an inpatient was sent to a clinic for treatment, or because of using Inpatient Medications for Outpatients (IMO) feature. When written unsigned orders exist and the patient's status changes, the user must indicate which location the orders are associated with.\nUsers designate which location the written unsigned orders are associated with in the Order Location dialog.\nThe order location dialog shows the user the two locations the user can choose from, generally an outpatient clinic and an inpatient location. The user has two basic options:\n·      Associate All of the orders with a single location by selecting the appropriate button above the list of orders. The buttons will read All location where location is the name of the clinic or ward location. In the above screen capture the buttons read All MICU and All Mental Health Clinic.\n·      Individually associate each order with one of the two locations. At the end of each order is a column to select the location for each order.\n \nIf the user is keeping the patient's chart open, such as selecting File | Review / Sign changes... and this dialog appears, the \"Where would you like to continue processing patient data?\" prompt displays enabling the user to choose either the ward location or the clinic location. This prompt does not appear if the user is exiting the chart or switching patients.\n \nTo sign a number of orders, use these steps:\n1.     Select the Orders tab.\n2.     Highlight the orders you want to sign.\nTo select a range of items, click the order at the beginning of the range; then hold down the SHIFT key and click the order at the end of the range. To select multiple, individual orders, select the first order, hold down the CTRL key, and click the next order.\n \n3.     Select Action | Sign Selected...\n-or-\nright-click and select Sign...\n \n4.     (Conditional) If CPRS displays order checks, review the order checks and take the appropriate action below:\n\nIn this screen capture, CPRS displays several possible conflicts between ordered medications. Users should review each item carefully before completing the order. If an order check is larger than the cell's available space, the user can hover with the mouse to the get the full text or use the arrow keys to highlight the order check if using the keyboard or accessibility product for visually challenged users. Some order checks require an override reason. These order checks are designated by the \"*Order Check requires Reason for Override\" text in red and the order check text in blue.\n \na)     To redo the orders to avoid a possible interaction, select Return to Orders. This will cancel the signature process, but not the order.\nb)     If the orders should not be placed, check the cancel check box in front of the orders that should not be placed and select Cancel Checked Order(s).\nc)     If the possible interactions are not a problem, type a reason for override (required only for critical order checks) select Continue.\nAfter performing step 1 and after addressing any order checks in step 2, one of the Review/Sign Changes dialogs shown below will appear. Each item that requires a signature will have a check box in front of it.\nNote:     All non-controlled substances orders will be checked for signature when the dialog displays. To sign controlled substances orders, the user must check the box for each order individually.\nThen, one of the following dialogs displays.\n\nFigure A\n \n\nFigure B: The Review/Sign changes dialog may have additional elements depending on the nature of the patient. In this case, the provider can sign controlled substances orders and the patient's conditions are not service-connected.\n \n\nFigure C: In this example of the Review/Sign Changes dialog, the provider can sign controlled substance orders, and the patient has either Combat Veteran status or service-connected conditions for which the provider must indicate the orders pertain.\n5.     If the simpler Electronic Signature dialog displays, select or deselect orders as needed and then enter your electronic signature code (if necessary) and select Sign. The orders will now be signed.\nIf the Review / Sign Changes dialog resembles Figure B or Figure C and contains question marks, continue to step 6.\n6.     To select Controlled Substance order to sign, place a check mark in the box to the left each Controlled Substance order to sign by clicking in the check box, or tabbing to it and pressing the <Space bar>.\nNote:     When the user checks the box to the left of any Controlled Substance order for signature, the phrase SMART card required displays next to the label Controlled Substance Orders.\n \n\nThis is what the dialog looks like before controlled substance outpatient orders are checked for signature.\n \n\nAfter the controlled substances orders are checked, the text about the \"smart card required\" and the text the provider is acknowledging display.\n \n7.     The blue question marks inside the boxes in Figure B indicate that you need to specify how that order is related to the medical condition in that column. (SC = Service Connected Condition, CV=Combat Veteran, AO=Agent Orange Exposure, IR=Ionizing Radiation Exposure, SWAC=Southwest Asia Conditions, SHD=Shipboard Hazard and Defense, MST=Military Sexual Trauma, and HNC=Head or Neck Cancer). If you place a check in a box, you are indicating that a medication order is related to the condition in that column. If you create an empty box, you are indicating that the medication order is not related to the condition in that column. You must either check or uncheck every box that contains a blue question mark before you can sign the order.\nNote:      Definitions for service connection and treatment factors are available to users by hovering the cursor over the term or using the appropriate keyboard shortcut as shown in the list below:\no     Service connection (SC)   Alt + c\no     Combat Veteran (CV)   Alt + v\no     Agent Orange (AO)    Alt + o\no     Ionizing Radiation (IR)   Alt + r\no     Southwest Asia Conditions (SWAC)  Alt + a\no     Shipboard Hazard and Defense (SHD) Alt + h\no     Head and/or Neck Cancer (HNC)  Alt + n\n \nYou can toggle the check boxes by:\no     Selecting an individual check box.\nThis will toggle the box between checked and unchecked.\no     To select all the check boxes in one column, press the button above the appropriate column (SC = Service Connected Condition, CV=Combat Veteran, AO=Agent Orange Exposure, IR=Ionizing Radiation Exposure, SWAC=Southwest Asia Conditions, SHD=Shipboard Hazard and Defense, MST=Military Sexual Trauma, and HNC=Head or Neck Cancer).\nThis will toggle all the check boxes in that column.\no     To check all check boxes on the dialog, press the All button.\nThis will toggle all the check boxes on the screen.\n \n8.     To select Controlled Substance order to sign, place a check mark in the box to the left each Controlled Substance order to sign by clicking in the check box, or tabbing to it and pressing the <Space bar>.\nNote:     When the user checks the box to the left of any Controlled Substance order for signature, the phrase \"SMART card required\" displays next to the label Controlled Substance Orders.\n \n9.     If you have not already done so, insert your PIV or smart  card.\nNote:      If you do not insert your PIV or smart card before attempting to sign the selected Controlled Substance orders, you will see the following two dialogs:\n \n\n \n\n10.  When you have removed all of the question marks from the dialog, enter your electronic signature code (the button will change from Don't Sign to Sign) and click Sign.\n11.   (Conditional) If your PIV card is already set up, you will not see the Digital Signing Setup dialog and you can proceed to step 11. If your PIV or Smart card is not yet linked to your VistA account, you will need to set it up before you can sign outpatient controlled substance medication orders. To set up your PIV or smart card to order outpatient controlled substance orders, select Yes.\n\nYou may then be asked to enter your PIN.\n\nThen, the signature process will proceed.\n \n12.   If the Order Check dialog appears, deal with any problems in the dialog: such as entering a reason for override, cancelling specific orders, etc. When ready, select the Accept Orders button.\n \n13.   When prompted, enter your PIN to sign the Controlled Substance orders and select OK or press <Enter>.\n\nWarning:      Do NOT enter an incorrect PIN five (5) consecutive times! If you enter the incorrect PIN five (5) consecutive times, your card will be until you visit a PIV issuing station.\nIf you enter the incorrect PIN three (3) times, CPRS temporarily locks your PIV or smart card for 15 minutes. Then, it will allow you to try again. However, you only have two (2) more attempts to get the correct PIN. If you get to five (5) consecutive incorrect PIN entries, the PIV card will be locked and you will have to go to a PIV station to unlock the card.\n \n \nRelated topics\nDigital Signature (PKI)

chart whether to select a new patient or to exit CPRS completely, CPRS prompts the user to sign unsigned orders that the user has privileges to sign. The dialog that CPRS displays may be different than the Review/Sign Changes… or Sign Selected dialogs based on the parameter settings. By changing the parameters settings, the dialog may display one or more of the following categories of unsigned orders:\n·      My Unsigned Orders - This Session\n·      My Unsigned Orders - Previous Sessions\n·      Others' Unsigned Orders - All Sessions\n \nSometimes during the ordering process, the status of a patient changes from outpatient to inpatient or vice versa. This might happen because an outpatient was admitted to the facility, or because an inpatient was sent to a clinic for treatment, or because of using Inpatient Medications for Outpatients (IMO) feature. When written unsigned orders exist and the patient's status changes, the user must indicate which location the orders are associated with.\nTo designate which location written unsigned orders are associated with, the following dialog will appear:\n\nThis dialog asks to which location CPRS should associate the orders that have been placed but not signed.\n \nThe order location dialog shows the user the two locations the user can choose from, generally an outpatient clinic and an inpatient location. The user has two basic options:\n·     Associate All of the orders with a single location by selecting the appropriate button above the list of orders. The buttons will read All location where location is the name of the clinic or ward location. In the above screen capture the buttons read All MICU and All Mental Health Clinic.\n·     Individually associate each order with one of the two locations. At the end of each order is a column to select the location for each order.\n \nIf the user selects File | Review / Sign changes... and this dialog appears, the \"Where would you like to continue processing patient data?\" prompt displays enabling the user to choose either the ward location or the clinic location. This prompt does not appear if the user is exiting the chart or switching patients.\nTo sign a number of orders, use these steps:\n1.     Select the Orders tab.\n2.     Highlight the orders you want to sign.\nTo select a range of items, click the order at the beginning of the range; then hold down the <Shift> key and click the order at the end of the range. To select multiple, individual orders, select the first order, hold down the CTRL key, and click the next order.\n \n3.     Select Action | Sign Selected...\n-or-\nright-click and select Sign...\n \n4.     (Conditional) If CPRS displays order checks, review the order checks and take the appropriate action below:\n\nIn this screen capture, CPRS displays several possible conflicts between ordered medications. Users should review each item carefully before completing the order. If an order check is larger than the cell's available space, the user can hover with the mouse to the get the full text or use the arrow keys to highlight the order check if using the keyboard or accessibility product for visually challenged users. Some order checks require an override reason. These order checks are designated by the \"*Order Check requires Reason for Override\" text in red and the order check text in blue.\n \na)    To redo the orders to avoid a possible interaction, select Return to Orders. This will cancel the signature process, but not the order.\nb)    If the orders should not be placed, check the cancel check box in front of the orders that should not be placed and select Cancel Checked Order(s).\nc)     If the possible interactions are not a problem, type a reason for override (required only for critical order checks) select Continue.\nAfter performing step 1 and after addressing any order checks in step 2, one of the Review/Sign Changes dialogs shown below will appear. Each item that requires a signature will have a check box in front of it.\nNote:      All non-controlled substances orders will be checked for signature when the dialog displays. To sign controlled substances orders, the user must check the box for each order individually.\nOne of the following signature dialogs will display.\n\nFigure A\n \n\nFigure B: The Review/Sign changes dialog may have additional elements depending on the nature of the patient. In this case, the provider can sign controlled substances orders and the patient's conditions are not service-connected.\n \n\nFigure C: In this example of the Review/Sign Changes dialog, the provider can sign controlled substance orders, and the patient has either Combat Veteran status or service-connected conditions for which the provider must indicate the orders pertain.\n \n \n5.     If the Electronic Signature dialog resembles Figure A, enter your electronic signature code (if necessary) and click Sign. The orders will now be signed.\nIf the Review / Sign Changes dialog resembles Figure B or Figure C and contains question marks, continue to step 6.\n6.     To select Controlled Substance order to sign, place a check mark in the box to the left each Controlled Substance order to sign by clicking in the check box, or tabbing to it and pressing the <Space bar>.\nNote:     When the user checks the box to the left of any Controlled Substance order for signature, the phrase SMART card required displays next to the label Controlled Substance Orders.\n \n\nThis is what the dialog looks like before controlled substance outpatient orders are checked for signature.\n \n\nAfter the controlled substances orders are checked, the text about the \"smart card required\" and the text the provider is acknowledging display.\n \n7.     The question marks inside the check boxes in Figure B indicate that you need to specify how that order is related to the medical condition in that column. (SC = Service Connected Condition, CV=Combat Veteran, AO=Agent Orange Exposure, IR=Ionizing Radiation Exposure, SWAC=Southwest Asia Conditions, SHD=Shipboard Hazard and Defense, MST=Military Sexual Trauma, and HNC=Head and/or Neck Cancer). If you place a check in a box, you are indicating that a medication order is related to the condition in that column. If you create an empty box, you are indicating that the medication order is not related to the condition in that column. You must either check or uncheck every box that contains a question mark before you can sign the order.\nNote:      Definitions for service connection and treatment factors are available to users by hovering the cursor over the term or using the appropriate keyboard shortcut as shown in the list below:\no     Service connection (SC)   Alt + c\no     Combat Veteran (CV)   Alt + v\no     Agent Orange (AO)    Alt + o\no     Ionizing Radiation (IR)   Alt + r\no     Southwest Asia Conditions (SWAC)  Alt + a\no     Shipboard Hazard and Defense (SHD) Alt + h\no     Military Sexual Trauma (MST)  Alt + m\no     Head and/or Neck Cancer (HNC)  Alt + n\n \n \nYou can toggle the check boxes by:\no     Selecting an individual check box or tabbing to the check box and pressing the spacebar.\nThis will toggle the box between checked and unchecked.\n \no     To check all check boxes in a column, select the button above the appropriate column.\nThis will toggle all the check boxes in that column.\n \no     Selecting the All button.\nThis will toggle all the check boxes on the dialog.\n \n8.     To select Controlled Substance order to sign, place a check mark in the box to the left each Controlled Substance order to sign by clicking in the check box, or tabbing to it and pressing the <Space bar>.\nNote:     When the user checks the box to the left of any Controlled Substance order for signature, the phrase \"SMART card required\" displays next to the label Controlled Substance Orders.\n \n9.     If you have not already done so, insert your PIV or smart card.\nNote:       If you do not insert your PIV or smart card before attempting to sign the selected Controlled Substance orders, you will see the following two dialogs:\n \n\n\n \n10.   When you have removed all of the question marks from the dialog, enter your electronic signature code (the button will change from Don't Sign to Sign) and click Sign.\n11.  (Conditional) If your PIV or smart card is already set up, you will not see the Digital Signing Setup dialog and you can proceed to step 11. If your PIV or smart card is not yet linked to your VistA account, you will need to set it up before you can sign outpatient controlled substance medication orders. To set up your PIV or smart card to order outpatient controlled substance orders, select Yes.\n\nYou may then be asked to enter your PIN.\n\nThen, the signature process will proceed.\n \n12.   If the Order Check dialog appears, deal with any problems in the dialog: such as entering a reason for override, cancelling specific orders, etc. When ready, select the Accept Orders button.\n \n13.   When prompted, enter your PIN to sign the Controlled Substance orders and select OK or press <Enter>.\n\nWarning:      Do NOT enter an incorrect PIN five (5) consecutive times! If you enter the incorrect PIN five (5) consecutive times, your card will be until you visit a PIV issuing station.\nIf you enter the incorrect PIN three (3) times, CPRS temporarily locks your PIV or smart card for 15 minutes. Then, it will allow you to try again. However, you only have two (2) more attempts to get the correct PIN. If you get to five (5) consecutive incorrect PIN entries, the PIV card will be locked and you will have to go to a PIV station to unlock the card.\n \n \nRelated topics\nUnderstanding Service Connection and Treatment Factors\nDigital Signature (PKI) Overview\nElectronic Signature (overview)\nSign Selected Orders Command\nSign Note Now and Sign Discharge Summary Now Commands\nAdd to Signature List\nViewing Unsigned Notes or Discharge Summaries\nIdentify Additional Signers\nCIDC: Entering Diagnosis Codes for Specific Orders\n \n\n\n","Path::contents/Sort_(Clinical_Reminders)_by.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/cprswt.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Sort_(Clinical_Reminders)_by.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/cprswt.css"}],"Path::contents/Sort_(Clinical_Reminders)_by.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Sort_(Clinical_Reminders)_by.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Sort_(Clinical_Reminders)_by.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Sort_(Clinical_Reminders)_by.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Sort_(Clinical_Reminders)_by.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Sort_(Clinical_Reminders)_by.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Sort_(Clinical_Reminders)_by.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Sort_(Clinical_Reminders)_by.htm::Title":"Sort (Clinical Reminders) by","Path::contents/Sort_(Clinical_Reminders)_by.htm::InnerText":"\nSelect a radio button to sort Clinical Reminders.\n\n\n","Path::contents/Signing_a_Surgery_Report.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Signing_a_Surgery_Report.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Surgery_tab.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Signing_a_Surgery_Report.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Surgery_tab.htm"},{"origLink":"Customizing_the_Surgery_Tab.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Signing_a_Surgery_Report.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Customizing_the_Surgery_Tab.htm"},{"origLink":"Creating_an_Addendum_to_a_Surgery_Report.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Signing_a_Surgery_Report.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Creating_an_Addendum_to_a_Surgery_Report.htm"},{"origLink":"Finding_specific_text_in_a_Document.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Signing_a_Surgery_Report.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Finding_specific_text_in_a_Document.htm"},{"origLink":"View_all_Surgery_Cases.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Signing_a_Surgery_Report.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/View_all_Surgery_Cases.htm"}],"Path::contents/Signing_a_Surgery_Report.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Signing_a_Surgery_Report.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Signing_a_Surgery_Report.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Signing_a_Surgery_Report.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Signing_a_Surgery_Report.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Signing_a_Surgery_Report.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Signing_a_Surgery_Report.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Signing_a_Surgery_Report.htm::Title":"Signing a Surgery Report","Path::contents/Signing_a_Surgery_Report.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Electronic:Signature,Surgery reports:signing reports","Path::contents/Signing_a_Surgery_Report.htm::InnerText":"\nSigning a Surgery Report\nDepending on the configuration of your site and your access permissions, you may be able to sign certain surgery reports.\nTo sign a surgery report, follow these steps:\n1.     Select the Surgery tab.\n2.     Select a surgery report from the All Surgery Cases pane.\n3.     Select Action | Sign Report Now...\n-or-\nright-click in the details pane and select Sign Report Now.\n \n4.     Enter your electronic signature code.\n5.     Select Sign.\n \nRelated Topics\nSurgery Tab\nCustomizing the Surgery Tab\nCreating an Addendum to a Surgery Report\nFinding Specific Text in a Document\nViewing all Surgery Cases for a Patient\n \n\n\n","Path::contents/Sort_Order.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/cprswt.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Sort_Order.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/cprswt.css"}],"Path::contents/Sort_Order.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Sort_Order.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Sort_Order.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Sort_Order.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Sort_Order.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Sort_Order.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Sort_Order.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Sort_Order.htm::Title":"Sort Order","Path::contents/Sort_Order.htm::InnerText":"\nPatients will be displayed sorted by this selection.

Checks","Path::contents/Site_Defined_Clinical_Reminder_Order_Checks.htm::InnerText":"\nSite-Defined Clinical Reminder Order Checks\nCPRS enables sites to create their own order checks based on the Clinical Reminders features. Sites will define a group of orderable items for which certain rules apply. If the rules apply to the situation, the site can define text that will display in the order check window. Sites can also set the order check to require an override.\nSetting Up Clinical Reminder Order Checks\nClinical Reminder order checks are defined at the site by those who normally work on the Clinical Reminders package. The set-up of a Clinical Reminders Order Check consists of two parts:\n·      This dialog prompts the user to insert the smart card so that they can proceed. Creating a group of orderable items to which the rules should apply.\n·      Creating the rules that will be applied to the orderable item when accepting an order in CPRS. It will be possible to have the same orderable item in multiple groups. Each rule assigned to the different groups will be evaluated when placing the orderable item in CPRS. The order check groups and the rule will be stored in the Reminder Order Check file.\n \nRules can either be defined to run against a reminder term or a reminder definition. A reminder term is beneficial when the request is to evaluate the presence of specific data (See Example #1). A reminder definition is beneficial if you need the full functionality of a reminder definition to determine if the rule should show in the order check form (See Example #2). The user setting up the Clinical Reminder order check can define only one or the other.\n \nNote:      Sites should evaluate all requests to create a Clinical Reminder Order Check to determine the importance of adding it. The more reminders that are used in an order check, the more they could affect the performance of the order check system.\nExample #1\nProblem: An order check is needed for the interaction between timolol ophthalmic (used to treat glaucoma) and over-the-counter (OTC) antihistamines (which should not be used in the more rare narrow angle glaucoma).\nSetup:\n1.     Create a reminder term that looks for the presence of a diagnosis of narrow angle glaucoma. (May need to look at multiple files depending on your site practice)\n2.     Create an Orderable Item Group that contains all orderable items for any OTC Antihistamines.\n3.     Create a Rule that contains the term created in step 1.\n4.     Set the rule to trigger the order check if the reminder term is evaluated at True.\n5.     Create the text that should appear in the order check window.\nExample of the Output in CPRS\n\nThis is an example of a Clinical Reminders order check.\nDescription of solution: A reminder term was used in the setup because the presence of Glaucoma was all that is needed to determine if the rule should trigger an order check. In the screen shot above, the text \"Diagnosis of Glaucoma\" was defined in the Display Name field. The rest of the text was defined in the Order Check Text field.\nExample #2\nProblem: Order Check is needed when ordering Glyburide for patients age 65 or greater and serum Cr 2.0 or greater.\nSetup:\n1.     Create a reminder definition that is applicable to the patient if the patient age is 65 or greater and the patient has a CR serum 2.0 or greater.\n2.     Create an Orderable Item Group that contains all orderable items for the Glyburide.\n3.     Create a Rule that contains the definition created in step 1.\n4.     Set the rule to trigger the order check if the reminder definition is applicable to the patient.\n5.     Create the text that should appear in the order check window. Set the order text to display the finding output in the order check text.\nExample of the output in CPRS\n\nThis is an example of a Clinical Reminders order checks that uses a rule and contains part of the definition.\nDescription of solution: We needed a reminder definition to match patients older than 64 who had a lab test with the results greater than 2. In this example we set the rule up to display both the order check text and the definition evaluation text. The text \"Glyburide Contraindicated\" is the display name. The text \"Avoid glyburide in patients with a calculated creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min or a creating 2 or greater. If an oral sulfonylurea is required, consider glipizide\" is defined by the site. The rest of the text is returned from the reminder definition evaluation.\nEnabling Users to See the Reminders Order Checks\nClinical Reminder Order checks are defined with a testing field. If the order check is being tested, the Clinical Application Coordinator (CAC) or similar person sets this field in the Clinical Reminders order check definition to True. Then, only users who have the Clinical Reminder Test order check set to Yes will receive the order check--allowing a small number of users to test the order check before it is enabled for all users in the facility.\nRelated topics\nOrder Checking Overview\nOrder Checking Local\nOrder Checking Remote\nOrdering a Diet\nOrdering Inpatient Medications (Simple Dose)\nOrdering Inpatient Medications (Complex Dose)\nOrdering Outpatient Medications (Simple Dose)\nOrdering Outpatient Medications (Complex Dose)\nOrdering IV Fluids\nOrdering Lab Tests\nOrdering Radiology and Imaging Procedures\nOrdering a Consult\nOrdering Vitals\nText Only Orders\nEvent-Delayed Orders\n \n\n\n","Path::contents/Source_Combinations.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/cprswt.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Source_Combinations.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/cprswt.css"}],"Path::contents/Source_Combinations.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Source_Combinations.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Source_Combinations.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Source_Combinations.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Source_Combinations.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Source_Combinations.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Source_Combinations.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Source_Combinations.htm::Title":"Source Combinations","Path::contents/Source_Combinations.htm::InnerText":"\nEdit the criteria for a patient list composed from multiple sources.\n\n\n","Path::contents/Start-Stop_(Imaging).htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/cprswt.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Start-Stop_(Imaging).htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/cprswt.css"}],"Path::contents/Start-Stop_(Imaging).htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Start-Stop_(Imaging).htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Start-Stop_(Imaging).htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Start-Stop_(Imaging).htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Start-Stop_(Imaging).htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Start-Stop_(Imaging).htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Start-Stop_(Imaging).htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Start-Stop_(Imaging).htm::Title":"Start-Stop (Imaging)","Path::contents/Start-Stop_(Imaging).htm::InnerText":"\nSelect the date range to display your imaging reports.\n\n\n","Path::contents/Surrogate_Settings.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/cprswt.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Surrogate_Settings.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/cprswt.css"}],"Path::contents/Surrogate_Settings.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Surrogate_Settings.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Surrogate_Settings.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Surrogate_Settings.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Surrogate_Settings.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Surrogate_Settings.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Surrogate_Settings.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Surrogate_Settings.htm::Title":"Surrogate Settings","Path::contents/Surrogate_Settings.htm::InnerText":"\nYou may designate or remove a surrogate to receive your alerts.

TIU alerts are given a Moderate urgency value. Other alerts without a parameter value are given an urgency of low.)\n·      Alert Date/Time (date/time the alert was triggered, newest to oldest or oldest to newest)\n·      Message (alert message or text, alphabetical or reverse alphabetical)\n·      Forwarded By/When (sorts alerts alphabetically and then by time for the same forwarding person)\n \nClicking a heading will sort the alerts by that heading.\n \nSorting Notification Columns Using the Mouse\nTo sort Notifications using the mouse, click the column heading you want to sort by. To reverse the sort order, click the same heading again. For example, a user could decide to sort by date and time. Normally, the most recent alerts are listed first. The user could click the column heading to reverse the order and have the oldest alerts displayed first. Clicking the column heading again would list the most recent alerts first.\nSorting Notifications Using the Keyboard\nUsers who do not use the mouse can sort Notifications in ascending order (alphabetical order or most recent Date/Time) using the keyboard only. When users sort using the Ctrl + <key> combination, CPRS will recognize either upper or lower case letters (this feature is not case-sensitive). Users can sort Notifications using the following Ctrl + <key> combinations:\n \nKey Combination Column Sorted\n Ctrl + I Info\n Ctrl + P Patient\n Ctrl + L Location\n Ctrl + U Urgency\n Ctrl + D Alert Date/Time \n Ctrl + M Message\n Ctrl + F Forwarded By/When\n \nNote:      A limitation exists in the programming environment that does not allow the user to user the same key combination to then reverse the sort. Making this change would not be trivial and will not be addressed the CPRS GUI at this time.\n \nViewing Comments of Forwarded Alerts\nUsers may also want to view comments associated with forwarded alerts. To view a comment, simply place the cursor over the alert, leave it still for a few seconds, and the comment will display. Move the mouse and the comment will no longer be displayed.\n\nThis graphic shows that when you place the cursor over a forwarded alert the associated comment will display.\n \nTo bring up the forwarded comment in a separate dialog, highlight the notification with the comment and select the Show Comment button.\n \nRelated topics\nNotifications and Alerts\nRemoving Notifications\nForwarding Notifications\nProcessing Notifications\nDeferring Notifications\n \n\n\n","Path::contents/Subscribe_to_a_team.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/cprswt.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Subscribe_to_a_team.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/cprswt.css"}],"Path::contents/Subscribe_to_a_team.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Subscribe_to_a_team.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Subscribe_to_a_team.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Subscribe_to_a_team.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Subscribe_to_a_team.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Subscribe_to_a_team.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Subscribe_to_a_team.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Subscribe_to_a_team.htm::Title":"Subscribe to a team","Path::contents/Subscribe_to_a_team.htm::InnerText":"\nYou can add yourself as a team member to those teams that allow subscription.\n\n\n","Path::contents/Team_members.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/cprswt.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Team_members.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/cprswt.css"}],"Path::contents/Team_members.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Team_members.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Team_members.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Team_members.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Team_members.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Team_members.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Team_members.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Team_members.htm::Title":"Team members","Path::contents/Team_members.htm::InnerText":"\nThese are the team members on the teams that have been selected.\n\n\n","Path::contents/Start-Stop_(Patient_Selection).htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/cprswt.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Start-Stop_(Patient_Selection).htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/cprswt.css"}],"Path::contents/Start-Stop_(Patient_Selection).htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Start-Stop_(Patient_Selection).htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Start-Stop_(Patient_Selection).htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Start-Stop_(Patient_Selection).htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Start-Stop_(Patient_Selection).htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Start-Stop_(Patient_Selection).htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Start-Stop_(Patient_Selection).htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Start-Stop_(Patient_Selection).htm::Title":"Start-Stop (Patient Selection)","Path::contents/Start-Stop_(Patient_Selection).htm::InnerText":"\nEnter a date range by entering a start and stop date.

Factors\nUpon electronic signature, providers will need to deal with the various exemptions for copayment for qualified veterans. To help providers better understand service connection and treatment factors, the following information is provided.\nService Connected\nThe assignment of service connected percentage and disability code is based on the degree of disability as determined by the rating board decision following the submission of a claim that a veteran's illness or injury was incurred in or aggravated by military service.\nAn adjunct condition, although not service connected, is medically determined to be associated with or is aggravating a disease or condition, which is service connected. A veteran is eligible to receive treatment for an adjunct condition; however, because the adjunct is not a condition that is specifically rated, VA can bill the insurance carrier as well as those veterans responsible for copayments for treatment provided for the adjunct condition.\nA secondary condition is defined as a condition that has been caused or is the result of a service-connected condition. This condition is also nonservice-connected and treatment provided is also billable.\nIt is important that the clinician be aware of the patient's service-connected conditions. This information is available by clicking the patient's name in the blue square in the upper left corner in CPRS. It is also found on the encounter form. If a patient is being treated for a service-connected condition during a visit, the provider should check the service-connected box on the encounter form \"yes\".\nCompensable service-connected veterans are not charged an outpatient copayment. However, nonservice-connected veterans and veterans rated less than 50% service-connected with income above the existing threshold may be charged a medication copayment if the medication is for a nonservice-connected condition. If the veteran has health insurance, a claim will be submitted to the insurance carrier for the treatment of nonservice-connected conditions.\nTreatment Factors/Environmental Indicators\nThe provider must make a clinical decision to determine if an encounter is for a SC condition or one of a number of special categories. If the veteran is being treated during the encounter for a condition that the provider believes is for SC or a special category, the provider should check \"Yes\" next to the appropriate category on the encounter form. The veteran will not be billed for the encounter if \"Yes\" is checked.\nMedication(s) for one of these conditions should be indicated during the outpatient medication ordering process. The veteran will not be charged a copayment for a medication that is for SC or a special category.\nThe Special Categories included are:\n·     Combat Veteran (CV)\n·     Agent Orange (AO)\n·     Ionizing Radiation (IR)\n·     Southwest Asia Conditions (SWAC) – includes Gulf War veterans\n·     Shipboard Hazard and Defense (SHD)\n·     Military Sexual Trauma (MST)\n·     Head and Neck Cancer (HNC), after nasopharyngeal radium treatment in service.\n·     Camp Lejeune (CL)\n \n \nCombat Veteran\nOverview of Combat Veteran Status\nTo qualify for the Combat Veteran (CV) exemption, the veteran must have served in combat operations after the Gulf War or in combat against a hostile force after November 11, 1998. In addition, the condition for which the veteran is treated must be related to that combat, the veteran must have registered as a combat veteran, and be within two years of separation from active military service. Finally, the condition must not be already considered to be service related or that exemption should apply.\nNote:     The Combat Veteran exemption is valid for two years from the date of separation from military service, not the registration date. For example, if a veteran registers for Combat Veteran status 18 months after the date of his or her separation, the veteran would be eligible for Combat Veteran exemption for six months only. For further details, see VHA Directive 2002-049, Combat Veterans Are Eligible for Medical Services for 2-Years after Separation from Military Service Notwithstanding Lack of Evidence for Service Connection.\nCombat Veteran Markers\nTo help users better identify Combat Veteran eligible patients so that appropriate care and prioritization occur for them, CPRS has added several items where Combat Veteran status is more clearly shown. This is especially true in Consults. These markers are shown in various places in CPRS, such as the Patient Selection screen, the buttons available from any tab, the Consults dialog and details, the SF-513 form, etc.\n·      Patient Selection Screen: When the user selects a patient with Combat Veteran status, CPRS indicates that patient is a combat veteran by displaying the letters CV and a date below the normal demographic information on the Patient Selection screen and above the Save Patient List Settings button. The marker is shown in the screen capture below surrounded by a red box.\n\n \n·      New Service Consult/Request Notifications: The lower portion of the Patient Selection screen is the list of notifications for the user that is logged in. For a new consult or procedure request for a veteran with Combat Veteran status, the letters CV and the date display behind the abbreviated patient identifier in the Patient column. The Combat Veteran notification marker is shown in the above screen capture outlined in red.\n·      Combat Veteran Button and Consult Details: Available from any CPRS tab, the Combat Veteran button displays the letters CV and the expiration date of Combat Veteran Status. The Button displays when the selected patient has Combat Veteran status. The button shares space with the Flag button. The Combat Veteran button only displays for patients with the status, otherwise, the Flag button is whole.\no     To get details, the user selects the button to display the Combat Veteran Details dialog. See Combat Veteran Details Dialog below.\no     When the user selects the consults from the treeview, the consults details show in the pane to the right. In this view, the Combat Veteran status is shown underneath the primary eligibility.\n\n \n \n·     Combat Veteran Details Dialog: When the user selects the Combat Veteran button, the Combat Veteran Details dialog displays with the following items:\no     Service Branch\no     Status\no     Separation Date\no     Expiration Date\no     OEF/OIF (If the patient served in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) or Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)\n\n \n·     Consult Order Dialog: The Combat Veteran status and expiration date display near the top of the Consult Order dialog.\n\n \n \n·      SF-513 Form: Several changes were made to this form:\no     At the top of the page on the SF-513, the Combat Veteran marker displays with the demographic information.\no     The patient's name was moved to the top of this form.\no     When printed, the patient's identifying information will be printed at the top of each page.\no     When printed, a page number will be printed at the bottom of each page.\n\n \n \nAgent Orange\nAgent Orange (AO) is an herbicide that was used in Vietnam between 1962 and 1971 to remove unwanted plant life that provided cover for enemy forces.  The VA has recognized the following conditions as associated with but not necessarily caused by exposure to Agent Orange:\n\nAL Amylodosis\nDiabetes (type 2)\nChloracne or other acneform disease consistent with chloracne (must occur within one year of exposure to AO).\nIschemic Heart Disease\nParkinson’s Disease\nPorphyria cutanea tarda (must occur within one year of exposure to AO).\nAcute and subacute peripheral neuropathy. (For purposes of this section, the term acute and subacute peripheral neuropathy means temporary peripheral neuropathy that appears within weeks or months of exposure to an herbicide agent and resolves within two years of the date of onset.)\nNumerous cancers:\n\n\nProstate cancer\nHodgkin's disease\nMultiple myeloma\nNon-Hodgkin's lymphoma\nRespiratory cancers (cancer of the lung, bronchus, larynx, or trachea). (Must occur within 30 years of exposure to Agent Orange.)\nSoft-tissue sarcoma (other than osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, or mesothelioma).\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia\n\n\n\n \nIonizing Radiation\nAtomic veterans may have been exposed to ionizing radiation in a variety of ways at various locations. Veterans exposed at a nuclear device testing site (the Pacific Islands, e.g., Bikini, NM, NV, etc.) or in Hiroshima and/or Nagasaki, Japan, may be included. Atomic veterans with exposure to ionizing radiation are entitled to receive treatment for conditions for this exposure. VA has recognized the following conditions by statute or regulation as being associated with radiation exposure:\nConditions Associated with Ionizing Radiation:\n·      All cancers/malignancies\n·      Posterior subcapsular cataracts\n·      Non-malignant thyroid nodular disease\n·      Parathyroid adenoma\n·      Tumors of the brain and central nervous system\nNote:      Atomic veterans do not have to receive an Ionizing Radiation Registry Exam to have these special treatment eligibilities.\n \nSouthwest Asia Conditions\nGulf War veterans were exposed to a wide variety of environmental hazards and potential harmful substances during their service in Southwest Asia. These include depleted uranium, pesticides, the anti-nerve gas pill pyridostigmine bromide, infectious diseases, chemical and biological warfare agents, and vaccinations (including anthrax and botulinum toxoid), and oil well free smoke and petroleum products. VA recognizes that there are other health risk factors encountered by Gulf War veterans. Veterans with service during the Gulf War are entitled to receive treatment for conditions for this service.\nIf the treatment provided during the encounter is for an illness or symptom that may possibly be associated with environmental contamination this should be indicated on the encounter form or medication order\nConditions Associated with Southwest Asia Conditions:\n·      Persistent fatigue\n·      Skin rash\n·      Headache\n·      Arthralgias/myalgias\n·      Sleep disturbance\n·      Forgetfulness\n·      Joint pain\n·      Shortness of breath/chest pain\n·      Feverishness\n·      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis\n \nShipboard Hazard and Defense\nVeterans with conditions recognized by VA as associated with Project 112/ SHAD, shipboard and land-based biological and chemical testing conducted by the United States (U.S.) military between 1962 and 1973 are eligible for enrollment in priority group 6, unless eligible for enrollment in a higher priority. In addition, veterans receive care at no charge for care and medications provided for treatment of conditions related to exposure.\n \nMilitary Sexual Trauma\nVA is authorized by law to provide counseling services to women and men veterans who experienced incidents of sexual trauma while they served on active duty in the military. This Law defines a sexual trauma as sexual harassment, sexual assault, rape and other acts of violence. It further defines sexual harassment as repeated unsolicited, verbal or physical contact of a sexual nature, which is threatening in nature.\nThe provider must make a clinical decision to determine if a visit or medication is for MST. If the veteran is being treated for any condition during this episode of care that the provider believes is for MST; the visit should be checked as related on the encounter form and the medication should be designated as for MST. This will mean that the veteran does not have to pay a copayment for the visit or the medication.\n \nHead and Neck Cancer\nVeterans with cancer of the head and neck and a history of receipt of Nasopharyngeal (NP) radium therapy are eligible to receive treatment. There are very specific dates and locations where this activity occurred. Eligibility for this special class needs to be verified by HAS. (Not all veterans receiving head and neck cancer treatment fall into this treatment category.)\nDuring the 1920s, nasopharyngeal (NP) radium therapy was developed to treat hearing loss caused by repeated ear infections. Radium-tipped rods were inserted into the nostrils and left in place for several minutes. Military physicians used NP radium to treat aerotitis media (barotrauma) in submariners, aviators, and divers. It is estimated that between 8,000 and 20,000 military personnel received NP radium treatments during World War II and until the 1960s. Veterans also included are those with documentation of NP radium treatment in active military, naval or air service; those who served as an aviator in the active military, naval or air service before the end of the Korean conflict; or underwent submarine training in active naval service before January 1, 1965. Veterans with exposure to NP radium treatments are eligible to receive treatment for conditions related head and neck cancer\nIf the veteran is being treated for any condition during this episode of care that is for Head and Neck Cancer; the visit should be checked as related on the encounter form and the medication should be designated for Head and Neck Cancer. This will mean that the veteran does not have to pay a copayment for the visit or the medication.\n \nCamp Lejeune\nFrom the 1950s to the 1980s, people living or working at the U.S. Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune (CL), NC, were exposed to drinking water contaminated with industrial solvents, benzene, and other chemicals. Veterans and family members who served on active duty or resided at Camp Lejeune for 30 days or more between Aug. 1, 1953 and Dec. 31, 1987 may be eligible for VA health benefits for 15 conditions:\n\nEsophageal cancer\nBreast cancer\nKidney cancer\nMultiple myeloma\nRenal toxicity\nFemale infertility\nScleroderma\nNon-Hodgkin's lymphoma\nLung cancer\nBladder cancer\nLeukemia\nMyelodysplastic syndromes\nHepatic steatosis\nMiscarriage\nNeurobehavioral effects\n\nOn August 6, 2012, President Obama signed into law the “Honoring America’s Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012” (P. L. 112-154). This law provides health care for Veterans who served on active duty at Camp Lejeune and reimbursement for health care to family members who resided at Camp Lejeune for not fewer than 30 days between August 1, 1953 and December 31, 1987. The law authorizes care for 15 medical conditions, even if there is insufficient medical evidence to conclude that such illnesses or conditions are attributable to the Veterans’ military service or family members’ residence at Camp Lejeune.\nNote:      The Camp Lejeune environmental indicator will not be available until the release of patch OR*3.0*407.\n \n \nRelated topics\nReview / Sign Changes\nSign Selected Orders\nCIDC: Entering Diagnosis Codes for Specific Orders\n \n\n\n","Path::contents/Use_Defaults_(Imaging).htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/cprswt.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Use_Defaults_(Imaging).htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/cprswt.css"}],"Path::contents/Use_Defaults_(Imaging).htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Use_Defaults_(Imaging).htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Use_Defaults_(Imaging).htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Use_Defaults_(Imaging).htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Use_Defaults_(Imaging).htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Use_Defaults_(Imaging).htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Use_Defaults_(Imaging).htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Use_Defaults_(Imaging).htm::Title":"Use Defaults (Imaging)","Path::contents/Use_Defaults_(Imaging).htm::InnerText":"\nSets the number of image reports and date range to the system defaults.\n\n\n","Path::contents/Unit_Dose.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Unit_Dose.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Unit_Dose.htm#DRUG","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Unit_Dose.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Unit_Dose.htm"},{"origLink":"Unit_Dose.htm#HPM_0P_","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Unit_Dose.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Unit_Dose.htm"},{"origLink":"Unit_Dose.htm#XIBMEX","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Unit_Dose.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Unit_Dose.htm"},{"origLink":"Unit_Dose.htm#E0DS_IM","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Unit_Dose.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Unit_Dose.htm"},{"origLink":"Unit_Dose.htm#BGF0ZRM","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Unit_Dose.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Unit_Dose.htm"},{"origLink":"Unit_Dose.htm#DG45MV1","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Unit_Dose.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Unit_Dose.htm"},{"origLink":"Unit_Dose.htm#BRIQR13","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Unit_Dose.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Unit_Dose.htm"},{"origLink":"Unit_Dose.htm#BASGNKB","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Unit_Dose.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Unit_Dose.htm"},{"origLink":"Unit_Dose.htm#KU3FNP","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Unit_Dose.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Unit_Dose.htm"},{"origLink":"Unit_Dose.htm#E_BL16","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Unit_Dose.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Unit_Dose.htm"}],"Path::contents/Unit_Dose.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Unit_Dose.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Unit_Dose.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Unit_Dose.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Unit_Dose.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Unit_Dose.htm::Bookmarks":[{"id":"DRUG","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"DRUG"},{"id":"HPM_0P_","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"HPM_0P_"},{"id":"XIBMEX","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"XIBMEX"},{"id":"E0DS_IM","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"E0DS_IM"},{"id":"BGF0ZRM","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"BGF0ZRM"},{"id":"DG45MV1","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"DG45MV1"},{"id":"BRIQR13","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"BRIQR13"},{"id":"BASGNKB","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"BASGNKB"},{"id":"KU3FNP","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"KU3FNP"},{"id":"E_BL16","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"E_BL16"}],"Path::contents/Unit_Dose.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Unit_Dose.htm::Title":"Unit Dose","Path::contents/Unit_Dose.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Administration times,Dosage,Drug,Medications:Med route,Nature of order,Provider,Schedule,Schedule:type,Schedule:unit dose,Self med,Unit Dose","Path::contents/Unit_Dose.htm::InnerText":"\nUnit Dose\nFor Unit Dose order entry, you must fill in the DRUG box.

When a new order is entered or an order entered through CPRS is finished by pharmacy the default Schedule Type is determined as described below:\n·      If a schedule type is defined for the Orderable Item selected, that schedule type is used for the order.\n·      If no schedule type has been found and if no schedule is defined, schedule type is CONTINUOUS.\n·      If no schedule type has been found and the schedule contains PRN, the schedule type is PRN.\n·      If no schedule type has been found and the schedule entered is found in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1), and a schedule type is defined for it, that schedule type is used for the order.\n·      If no schedule type has been found and the schedule is \"NOW\", \"STAT\", \"ONCE\", or \"ONE-TIME\" the schedule type is ONCE.\n·      If the schedule type determined above is DAY OF WEEK the schedule type is set to CONTINUOUS.\n·      If no schedule type was determined above, the schedule type is CONTINUOUS.\n \nSchedule\nThis defines the frequency the order is to be administered. Schedules may be selected from the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) or day-of-week or admin/time schedules may be used. Unit Dose recognizes schedules in the following formats:\n·      QxH - Hourly schedules where x is the number of hours between administrations\n·      QxD - Daily schedules where x is the number of days between administrations\n·      QxM - Monthly schedules where x is the number of months between administrations\n \nIf a schedule is defined for the Orderable Item selected when entering a new order, that schedule is displayed as the default for the order.\n \nAdministration Times\nThis defines the time(s) of day the order is to be given. If the schedule for the order contains \"PRN\" any administration times for the order will be ignored. In new order entry the default administration times are determined as described below:\n·      If administration times are defined for the Orderable Item selected, they will be shown as the default for the order.\n·      If administration times are defined in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) for the patient's ward and the order's schedule, they will be shown as the default for the order.\n·      If administration times are defined for the Schedule, they will be shown as the default for the order.\n \nProvider\nThis identifies the provider who authorized the order. Only users identified as providers who are authorized to write medication orders may be selected.\n \nSelf Med\nIdentifies the order as to be given for administration by the patient. This prompt is only shown if the 'SELF MED' IN ORDER ENTRY field of the INPATIENT WARD PARAMETERS file (#59.6) is set to on.\n \nNature of Order\nThis specifies how the order originated. An order can be specified as written on the chart, telephoned, or verbal. This data is stored and displayed through OE/RR.\n \n\n\n","Path::contents/Up_arrow.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/cprswt.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Up_arrow.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/cprswt.css"}],"Path::contents/Up_arrow.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Up_arrow.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Up_arrow.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Up_arrow.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Up_arrow.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Up_arrow.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Up_arrow.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Up_arrow.htm::Title":"Up arrow","Path::contents/Up_arrow.htm::InnerText":"\nMoves selected reminders up so that they are displayed in the order they are displayed here on the cover sheet.\n\n\n","Path::contents/Unsigned_orders.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/CPRS.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Unsigned_orders.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CPRS.css"},{"origLink":"Review___Sign_Changes_Dialog.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Unsigned_orders.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Review___Sign_Changes_Dialog.htm"}],"Path::contents/Unsigned_orders.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Unsigned_orders.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Unsigned_orders.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Unsigned_orders.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Unsigned_orders.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Unsigned_orders.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Unsigned_orders.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Unsigned_orders.htm::Title":"Unsigned orders","Path::contents/Unsigned_orders.htm::InnerText":"\nUnsigned Orders\nBefore orders can be processed, they must receive an electronic signature or be designated as Signed on Chart.

The first way is by using the date pane in the lower left corner of the labs tab when a report is selected as shown below. In this screen capture, the nationally released order for the reports is displayed in the Lab Results pane.  \n\n \nThe second way, added with CPRS GUI v.30.B, enables sites to set a parameter to instead have the date ranges set using radio buttons above the main data pane. In the screen capture below, the parameter to have a different report at the top of the Lab Results pane has also been set.\n\n \nTo view lab test results, use these steps:\n1.     Select the Labs tab.\n2.     In the Lab Results box, select the type of results you want to see.\nNote: A plus sign (+) by a lab test means it has a schedule.\nFor some selections,  you must determine which test results you want to see.

One is the traditional Remote Data View which has been streamlined, the other is VistAWeb. Each system has its advantages.\nThe rest of this section follows Remote Data Views. If you want to use VistAWeb, documentation is available on the VistAWeb page at: http://domaindomain.ext/vistaweb/\nTo view a patient's remote data, use these steps:\n1.     After opening the patient's record, see if the text on the Remote Data button is blue. If the text is blue, the patient has remote data.\n2.     Select the tab you want remote data from (e.g., Labs or Reports).\n3.     Select the Remote Data button to display a list of sites that have remote data for the selected patient.\n4.     Select the sites you want to view remote data from by selecting the check box in front of the site name and then select the Remote Data button again to close the list.\n5.     Select the report or lab you would like to view from the Available Reports or Lab Results section on the left-side of the screen (click the plus sign in order to expand a report heading).\nNote:      With the exception of the DoD Consults report, choosing a Department of Defense (DoD) report does not limit you to DoD data. For example, if you choose Microbiology under Dept. of Defense, you will get DoD data and remote VA data. You do not have to run a separate report to get VA data.\nIt may take a few minutes to retrieve the data. While CPRS retrieves the data, the message \"Transmission in Progress\" will be displayed on the tab.\nNote: For remote data, the local and remote sites must use the same names for the data they want. Nationally released health summaries will work.\nDepending on how the report or lab is configured, CPRS will return the remote data in one of two ways.\nText Format with Site Tabs\nIf the remote data is in text format, the data from each remote site will be displayed under a separate site tab. To view data from a particular site, click on the appropriate tab.\nTable format\nIf the report or lab is available in table view, CPRS will return data from all of the sites in a single table. The \"facility\" column indicates where the data in a particular row was collected. The table can be sorted by facility or by any other column heading (alphabetically, numerically, or by date) by selecting the appropriate heading. Selecting on the heading again will sort the table in inverse order.\n \n6.     To see detailed information about a particular item in the table, select that item.

In the CPRS GUI, there are three places where users can see if a patient has PRF:\n·      The Patient Record Flag Pop-up Box\n·      The CPRS Cover Sheet\n·      The Flag button (available from any tab)\n \nWhen the user selects a patient name from the Patient Selection Screen, CPRS begins to load the record, displays any relevant messages (\"means test require\", deceased patient, sensitive record, etc.), and then, if the record is flagged, displays a pop-up box with the flag titles for the selected patient to ensure that the user sees the flags. The pop-up box is shown below.\nThe Patient Record Flags pop-up box displays a list of all flags for the patient, with the first flag in the list highlighted and the narrative for that flag displayed below the flag list and a list of links to notes that have been linked to flag actions. Category I flags are displayed first, followed by any Category II (or local) flags.\nThe flag narrative is the text the person assigning the flag enters that they want the user to see. It should give the purpose of the flag and may also contain examples of past behavior and instructions for users to follow when encountering the patient. For example, the narrative for a particular Behavioral flag might state that a patient has been known to carry weapons and has verbally threatened VHA staff in the past. It may also recommend that users call the VA police if this patient comes in for care. However, the purpose of Patient Record Flags is not to stigmatize nor discriminate, rather it is protect VHA staff and patients and to ensure the efficient delivery of health care.\nOn the bottom of the Patient Record Flags popup box, CPRS displays a list of notes that are linked to specific flag actions. Links will only display for those notes that have been signed and linked to a flag action. When the user selects a link, CPRS displays the linked progress note for the action in a detailed display window.\nUsers can review the flags or close the box.\nWhen the user is already in a patient record and wants to view Patient Record Flags, the user can use either the listing on the Cover Sheet or the Flag button. On the CPRS Cover Sheet, a new box called Patient Record Flags has been added above the Postings area. Flags for the selected patient are listed in the box.\nThe Flag button is visible from all CPRS tabs. If a patient's record has been flagged, the Flag button with its red text displays next to the Remote Data button. If the patient's record does not have any flags, the text on the button is grayed out instead of red. The Cover Sheet and Flag button are shown in the graphic below.\n \n\nThis screen capture shows the red text on the Flag button indicating this patient record has PRF and shows the flag list on the CPRS Cover Sheet.\n \nTo view a Patient Record Flag when entering a record, use the following steps:\n1.     Select a patient from the Patient Selection screen by either double-clicking on a patient name or highlighting the name and pressing the <Enter> key.\nNote:      When the record loads, CPRS checks to see if the record is sensitive and displays a warning to the user that the user must acknowledge to proceed. Then, if the record has one or more flags, CPRS displays a pop-up box with the patient's record flags title. The first flag is highlighted and the narrative details displayed below. If CPRS displays the pop-up box, the user must close this box before CPRS will load the patient chart.\n \n2.     Then, bring up the flag narrative you want to view by selecting the flag name or highlighting the flag name with the tab and arrow keys and pressing <Tab> (note that the number of flags in each category is listed after the category label).\n \n\nThis graphic shows the Patient Record Flag pop-up box listing the patient's flags, the narrative for the highlighted flag, and the links to any signed, linked progress notes documenting the reasons for the flag. Using the Flag button or clicking on a flag title on the Cover Sheet also displays this pop-up box. Category I flags are in the orange field, they blink, and the text changes color from white to black and back. Category II flags are in the field below.\n \n3.     To view the linked progress note, select the appropriate link in the lower part of the dialog.

After CPRS v. 27, IV orders entered through the Infusion dialog should display under the Infusion display group, while those entered through the Unit Dose dialog should display under the Inpatient display group (Inpt. Meds). However, the key is how the pharmacist finishes the order. If the pharmacist finishes the order as a Unit Dose medication, it will display under the Inpatient display group. If finished as an IV order, then CPRS displays the order under the Infusion display group.\nChanging the View on the Orders Tab\nTo create a specific view of the orders, users have the Custom Order View menu option.

A coordinator can set that value for your site.\n The appropriate orders will appear on the Orders tab.\n If you would like to filter the orders further, continue with step 3.\n \n3.     Select View | Custom Order View....\nThe Custom Order View dialog displays. The settings in the dialog should match what is currently displayed on the Orders tab.\nNote:      To view Inpatient Medication for Outpatient orders, users can expand the All Services service/section and then select Clinic Orders or they can expand All Services, expand Pharmacy, and then select Clinic Orders.\n \n4.     Select the criteria for the orders that you want to display on the Orders tab by doing some or all of the following:\no      Select an order status from the left side of the window. (Select the + to expand a heading.)\no      Select a service or section from the right side of the window.\no      If you would like to limit the orders to a specific date range, check the Only List Orders Placed During Time Period check box and enter a from and through date.
