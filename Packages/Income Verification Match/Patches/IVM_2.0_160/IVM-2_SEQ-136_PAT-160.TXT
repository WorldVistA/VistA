 The Health Eligibility Center (HEC) requested modifications to the
 Enrollment System (ES) to support the requirements for the Enrollment
 Customer Enhancements (ECE) and Enrollment System Enhancements projects
 and the Enrollment System (ES) 4.1 release.
  
 This patch modifies the Income Verification Match 2.0 application to send
 the value of the BT FINANCIAL INDICATOR (#4) field in the ANNUAL MEANS TEST
 (#408.31) file and the value of the CONTRIBUTED TO SPOUSAL SUPPORT (#.21)
 field in the INCOME RELATION (#408.22) file to the Enrollment System (ES)
 via the HL7 Z07 messages.  In addition, VistA will receive and store the
 CONTRIBUTED TO SPOUSAL SUPPORT value in the HL7 Z10 messages to the
 CONTRIBUTED TO SPOUSAL SUPPORT (#.21) field in the INCOME RELATION
 (408.22) file.
  
 1. Modify the Z07 builder to add the value of the BT FINANCIAL INDICATOR
 (BTFI) (#4) field in the ANNUAL MEANS TEST (#408.31) file to the HL7 Z07
 messages in the ZMT-31 segment-sequence.
  
 2. Modify the Z07 builder to add the value of the CONTRIBUTED TO SPOUSAL
 SUPPORT (#.21) field in the INCOME REATION (#408.22) file to the HL7 Z07
 messages in the ZIR-15 segment-sequence.
  
 3. Modify the receiver to store the CONTRIBUTED TO SPOUSAL SUPPORT value
 to the CONTRIBUTED TO SPOUSAL SUPPORT (#.21) field in the INCOME RELATION
 (#408.22) file; when received in the ZIR-15 segment-sequence on the HL7
 Z10 message from ES.
