(PSO*7*391):

"BLD",8061,1,31,0)
1. When processing a digitally signed pending order, the integrity of the 
"BLD",8061,1,32,0)
original order placed in CPRS is now being checked to ensure that the data
"BLD",8061,1,33,0)
fields listed below are not altered from the time the order is signed in
"BLD",8061,1,34,0)
CPRS and later selected for processing in backdoor pharmacy. This is done
"BLD",8061,1,35,0)
by passing the data elements listed below to a Kernel Application
"BLD",8061,1,36,0)
Programming Interface (API), Integration Control Registration (ICR) #3539,
"BLD",8061,1,37,0)
along with the CPRS hash count, provided by ICR #5709. The Kernel API
"BLD",8061,1,38,0)
compares these two hash values and returns an "OK" if the pending order is
"BLD",8061,1,39,0)
unaltered or otherwise, returns a "-1^error code^error message."
"BLD",8061,1,40,0)
 
"BLD",8061,1,41,0)
Example: "-1^89802016^Mismatched digital signature hash values."
"BLD",8061,1,42,0)
 
"BLD",8061,1,43,0)
These are the fields used in the hash check:
"BLD",8061,1,44,0)
        Date of Issuance
"BLD",8061,1,45,0)
        Full Name and Address of the Patient
"BLD",8061,1,46,0)
        Drug Name
"BLD",8061,1,47,0)
        Quantity Prescribed  
"BLD",8061,1,48,0)
        Directions for Use

        Prescriber Name   
"BLD",8061,1,50,0)
        Prescriber Address (site address) 
"BLD",8061,1,51,0)
        Prescriber DEA / VA Registration Number
"BLD",8061,1,52,0)
        Order Number (CPRS)
"BLD",8061,1,53,0)
 
"BLD",8061,1,54,0)
The Kernel API will also check for the validity of the DEA certificate. If
"BLD",8061,1,55,0)
the certificate is revoked or expired then the API will return the
"BLD",8061,1,56,0)
appropriate error code.
"BLD",8061,1,57,0)
If the error code is related to hash mismatch or the DEA certificate is
"BLD",8061,1,58,0)
revoked then the following events will be triggered during pending order
"BLD",8061,1,59,0)
processing:
"BLD",8061,1,60,0)
  The order will be auto discontinued.
"BLD",8061,1,61,0)
  First line of the pending order screen will have the message "Digital
"BLD",8061,1,62,0)
  Signature Failed: Corrupted (Hash mismatch)" or "Certificate revoked"
"BLD",8061,1,63,0)
  concatenated with "Order Auto Discontinued", and the message will be
"BLD",8061,1,64,0)
  highlighted in reverse video.
"BLD",8061,1,65,0)
  The status bar of the screen will have the message "Signature Failed: 
"BLD",8061,1,66,0)
  Corrupted (Hash mismatch)" or Certificate revoked."
"BLD",8061,1,67,0)
  A mail message will be generated to the holders of the PSDMGR key 
"BLD",8061,1,68,0)
  notifying that the order has been auto discontinued (similar to the 
"BLD",8061,1,69,0)
  example listed below).
"BLD",8061,1,70,0)
  If the discontinuation is due to a hash mismatch as a result of altering
"BLD",8061,1,71,0)
  one of the fields listed above then the mail message will show the
"BLD",8061,1,72,0)
  altered fields with the discrepancies. Here is an example:

"BLD",8061,1,123,0)
   provider name, or the number of refills will not be allowed to be 
"BLD",8061,1,124,0)
   edited. Also, if the changes to the dispense drug would result in
"BLD",8061,1,125,0)
   a new order being created, this will not be allowed for digitally 
"BLD",8061,1,126,0)
   signed orders. The user WILL be allowed to select other dispense drugs

   supply is decreased, the number of refills will also be adjusted 
"BLD",8061,1,133,0)
   accordingly depending on the drug setup (maximum refills, not 
"BLD",8061,1,134,0)
   refillable etc).

"BLD",8061,1,136,0)
8. In patch PSO*7*99, a change was made for pending orders not to 
"BLD",8061,1,137,0)
   recalculate the quantity for CS drugs on selecting a different strength
"BLD",8061,1,138,0)
   of the same drug and resulting in the same prescribed dosage. This
"BLD",8061,1,139,0)
   change is removed in this patch.

"BLD",8061,1,150,0)
11. A new field BACKDOOR SIGNATURE STATUS (#311) is being added to the 
"BLD",8061,1,151,0)
    PRESCRIPTION file (#52) and will be set to '1' to indicate that the CS
"BLD",8061,1,152,0)
    order was entered via pharmacy backdoor and was not digitally signed.
"BLD",8061,1,153,0)
 
"BLD",8061,1,154,0)
12. A new field, DIRECTIONS FOR USE (#120) is being added to the PENDING
"BLD",8061,1,155,0)
    OUTPATIENT ORDERS file (#52.41) to store the raw HEALTH LEVEL SEVEN
"BLD",8061,1,156,0)
    (HL7) dosage data as sent from CPRS. This will be used to validate the

13. Currently, the pending order screen displays only the number of 
"BLD",8061,1,160,0)
    refills ordered by the provider. For digitally signed orders, this
"BLD",8061,1,161,0)
    is modified to include the days supply and the quantity. Here is a
"BLD",8061,1,162,0)

14. The protocols PSO LM ACCEPT and PSO LM RENEW MENU are being modified
"BLD",8061,1,169,0)
    to add code to the SCREEN field (#24) and the HEADER field (#26) of
"BLD",8061,1,170,0)
    the PROTOCOL file (#101) to ensure users are limited to ListMan
"BLD",8061,1,171,0)

"BLD",8061,1,173,0)
15. As part of this project, Kernel patch XU*8*580 introduced the 
"BLD",8061,1,174,0)
    following new fields to the NEW PERSON file (#200). Apart from the 
"BLD",8061,1,175,0)
    DEA#/VA# requirement, DEA further classifies what CS schedule a
"BLD",8061,1,176,0)
    provider is authorized to write. 
"BLD",8061,1,177,0)
 
"BLD",8061,1,178,0)
    55.1      SCHEDULE II NARCOTIC (S), [PS3;1]
"BLD",8061,1,179,0)
    55.2      SCHEDULE II NON-NARCOTIC (S), [PS3;2]
"BLD",8061,1,180,0)
    55.3      SCHEDULE III NARCOTIC (S), [PS3;3]
"BLD",8061,1,181,0)
    55.4      SCHEDULE III NON-NARCOTIC (S), [PS3;4]
"BLD",8061,1,182,0)
    55.5      SCHEDULE IV (S), [PS3;5]
"BLD",8061,1,183,0)
    55.6      SCHEDULE V (S), [PS3;6]
"BLD",8061,1,184,0)
 
"BLD",8061,1,185,0)
    If any one of the above fields are populated for a provider then when
"BLD",8061,1,186,0)
    placing a new order in backdoor pharmacy, the software will now check
"BLD",8061,1,187,0)
    for the drug schedule with the provider privileges. If the provider
"BLD",8061,1,188,0)
    does not have the credentials to write such orders then the software
"BLD",8061,1,189,0)
    will display a message (as shown below) and will not allow the 
"BLD",8061,1,190,0)
    selection that provider.
"BLD",8061,1,191,0)
    Example: When the provider does not have schedule 2 privileges, this
"BLD",8061,1,192,0)
    message is displayed: 
"BLD",8061,1,193,0)
    "Provider not authorized to write Federal Schedule 2 prescriptions."
"BLD",8061,1,194,0)
 
"BLD",8061,1,195,0)
16. When placing an order for a CS Detoxification drug, the software will 
"BLD",8061,1,196,0)
    now check for a valid Detoxification number for the provider. If the 
"BLD",8061,1,197,0)
    provider does not have a Detoxification number then the software will 
"BLD",8061,1,198,0)
    display a message "Provider must have a DETOX# to order this drug."
"BLD",8061,1,199,0)
 
"BLD",8061,1,200,0)
17. The Released and Unreleased Prescription Report [PSO RELEASE REPORT] 
"BLD",8061,1,201,0)
    is being modified to include CS as a selection to the input. The drug
"BLD",8061,1,202,0)
    name and CS schedule is being added to the output. Here are the
"BLD",8061,1,203,0)

19. Currently, the default days supply for all drugs is set from the DAYS 
"BLD",8061,1,238,0)
    SUPPLY field (#3) of the RX PATIENT STATUS file (#53) up to a maximum
"BLD",8061,1,239,0)
    of 90. With this project, the default for CS schedule II-V drugs will
"BLD",8061,1,240,0)
    be set to 30 or from the DAYS SUPPLY field (#3) of the RX PATIENT
"BLD",8061,1,241,0)
    STATUS file (#53) if it is less than 30. Also, the Integration Control
"BLD",8061,1,242,0)
    Registration #3278 that returns days supply (DSUP^PSOSIGDS) to CPRS is
"BLD",8061,1,243,0)
    modified to return 30 or from the DAYS SUPPLY field (#3) of the RX
"BLD",8061,1,244,0)
    PATIENT STATUS file (#53) if it is less than 30 for CS schedule II-V
"BLD",8061,1,245,0)
    drugs.

"BLD",8061,1,247,0)
20. The pharmacy release slip portion of the Laser Label is being 
"BLD",8061,1,248,0)

"BLD",8061,1,253,0)
    ensure that when editing an orderable item/dispensed drug, the 
"BLD",8061,1,254,0)
    instruction field is displayed only when editing the pending order 
"BLD",8061,1,255,0)
    and not when editing an active or non-verified order.

22. The Expire Prescriptions [PSO EXPIRE PRESCRIPTIONS] option that 
"BLD",8061,1,258,0)
    currently runs as a nightly job is being modified to check for the
"BLD",8061,1,259,0)
    Institutional DEA 'expiration date'. If the expiration date is within
"BLD",8061,1,260,0)
    30 calendar days or past expiration then a mail message will be

1. When processing a digitally signed pending order, the integrity of the 
"PKG",141,22,1,"PAH",1,1,32,0)
original order placed in CPRS is now being checked to ensure that the data
"PKG",141,22,1,"PAH",1,1,33,0)
fields listed below are not altered from the time the order is signed in
"PKG",141,22,1,"PAH",1,1,34,0)
CPRS and later selected for processing in backdoor pharmacy. This is done
"PKG",141,22,1,"PAH",1,1,35,0)
by passing the data elements listed below to a Kernel Application
"PKG",141,22,1,"PAH",1,1,36,0)
Programming Interface (API), Integration Control Registration (ICR) #3539,
"PKG",141,22,1,"PAH",1,1,37,0)
along with the CPRS hash count, provided by ICR #5709. The Kernel API
"PKG",141,22,1,"PAH",1,1,38,0)
compares these two hash values and returns an "OK" if the pending order is
"PKG",141,22,1,"PAH",1,1,39,0)
unaltered or otherwise, returns a "-1^error code^error message."
"PKG",141,22,1,"PAH",1,1,40,0)

revoked then the following events will be triggered during pending order
"PKG",141,22,1,"PAH",1,1,59,0)
processing:
"PKG",141,22,1,"PAH",1,1,60,0)
  The order will be auto discontinued.

"PKG",141,22,1,"PAH",1,1,63,0)
  concatenated with "Order Auto Discontinued", and the message will be
"PKG",141,22,1,"PAH",1,1,64,0)
  highlighted in reverse video.
"PKG",141,22,1,"PAH",1,1,65,0)

    placing a new order in backdoor pharmacy, the software will now check
"PKG",141,22,1,"PAH",1,1,187,0)
    for the drug schedule with the provider privileges. If the provider
"PKG",141,22,1,"PAH",1,1,188,0)
    does not have the credentials to write such orders then the software
"PKG",141,22,1,"PAH",1,1,189,0)
    will display a message (as shown below) and will not allow the 
"PKG",141,22,1,"PAH",1,1,190,0)
    selection that provider.
"PKG",141,22,1,"PAH",1,1,191,0)
    Example: When the provider does not have schedule 2 privileges, this
"PKG",141,22,1,"PAH",1,1,192,0)

16. When placing an order for a CS Detoxification drug, the software will 
"PKG",141,22,1,"PAH",1,1,196,0)
    now check for a valid Detoxification number for the provider. If the 
"PKG",141,22,1,"PAH",1,1,197,0)
    provider does not have a Detoxification number then the software will 
"PKG",141,22,1,"PAH",1,1,198,0)
    display a message "Provider must have a DETOX# to order this drug."
