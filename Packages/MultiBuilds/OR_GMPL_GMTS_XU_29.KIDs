This cross-reference builds two indexes, one for finding
"IX",9000011,9000011,"ACR",.1,2,0)
all patients with a particular ICD9 code and one for
"IX",9000011,9000011,"ACR",.1,3,0)
finding all the ICD9 codes a patient has. The indexes are
"IX",9000011,9000011,"ACR",.1,4,0)
stored in the Clinical Reminders index global as:
"IX",9000011,9000011,"ACR",.1,5,0)

"IX",9000011,9000011,"ACR",.1,8,0)
 
"IX",9000011,9000011,"ACR",.1,9,0)
STATUS can be "A" for active or "I" for inactive.
"IX",9000011,9000011,"ACR",.1,10,0)
PRIORITY can be "A" for acute or "C" for chronic. If
"IX",9000011,9000011,"ACR",.1,11,0)
PRIORITY is missing then a "U" will be stored in the index.
"IX",9000011,9000011,"ACR",.1,12,0)
For Problems whose PRIORITY is "C" Clinical Reminders uses
"IX",9000011,9000011,"ACR",.1,13,0)
today's date for the date of the Problem. In all other
"IX",9000011,9000011,"ACR",.1,14,0)
cases Clinical Reminders uses DLM where DLM is the date last modified.
"IX",9000011,9000011,"ACR",.1,15,0)
When Problems are "removed" then CONDITION is set
"IX",9000011,9000011,"ACR",.1,16,0)
to "H" for hidden. Hidden Problems are not indexed.
"IX",9000011,9000011,"ACR",.1,17,0)

A New Term Rapid Turnaround (NTRT) mail message has been sent to the

Standards & Terminology Services (STS) team, and the site coordinator has 
"KRN",3.6,275,1,13,0)
been copied on the message thread. This is informational only and no work

is required by the site coordinator for processing of this request.
"KRN",3.6,275,1,15,0)
 
"KRN",3.6,275,1,16,0)
This request is generated when a user from the listed facility selects a 
"KRN",3.6,275,1,17,0)
valid SNOMED CT problem/diagnosis from the extended search option when 
"KRN",3.6,275,1,18,0)
the initial search does not find a suitable term. The selected 
"KRN",3.6,275,1,19,0)
problem/diagnosis already has a SNOMED CT ID, but it will be assigned a 
"KRN",3.6,275,1,20,0)
temporary ICD-9-CM code of 799.9 until a correct ICD-9-CM code is 
"KRN",3.6,275,1,21,0)
assigned 
"KRN",3.6,275,1,22,0)
 
"KRN",3.6,275,1,23,0)
After the SNOMED CT problem/diagnosis term is mapped to a valid ICD-9-CM 
"KRN",3.6,275,1,24,0)
code or set of codes, it will be deployed through the NTRT process and 
"KRN",3.6,275,1,25,0)
become available for selection by all users who use the search function 
"KRN",3.6,275,1,26,0)
within the Problem List application. The ICD-9-CM code 799.9 will be 
"KRN",3.6,275,1,27,0)
automatically updated to the correct ICD-9-CM code after the NTRT 
"KRN",3.6,275,1,28,0)

This bulletin will be delivered to the OR CACS Mail Group. It informs the 
"KRN",3.6,274,3,2,0)
group that a new NTRT Request has been initiated by a Clinician at their 
"KRN",3.6,274,3,3,0)
facility. Upon receipt, the CACs should discuss the request internally, 
"KRN",3.6,274,3,4,0)
and with their local Medical Records Committee. If the group concurs, they
"KRN",3.6,274,3,5,0)
should file an official NTRT request for the new term/expression at the
"KRN",3.6,274,3,6,0)

The NTRT Terminology Stewards for the Problem List Domain will consider
"KRN",3.6,274,3,11,0)
the request, and inform the facility of their decision as to whether the

new term should be added to the Enterprise Terminology.
"KRN",3.6,274,3,13,0)
 
"KRN",3.6,274,3,14,0)

filing an NTRT Request, and discuss the decision with the requester.

The purpose of this file is to satisfy the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) requirement
"^DIC",101.52,101.52,"%D",2,0)
for an electronic prescribing system to maintain an archive of all controlled 
"^DIC",101.52,101.52,"%D",3,0)
substance prescriptions that were electronically entered.
"^DIC",101.52,101.52,"%D",4,0)
 
"^DIC",101.52,101.52,"%D",5,0)
The file will store all the information that is considered a part of the 
"^DIC",101.52,101.52,"%D",6,0)
prescription.
"^DIC",101.52,101.52,"%D",7,0)
 
"^DIC",101.52,101.52,"%D",8,0)
The file should always be audited. In addition, the file should NEVER be
"^DIC",101.52,101.52,"%D",9,0)
edited using FileMan. These are both DEA requirements.
"^DIC",101.52,101.52,"%D",10,0)
 
"^DIC",101.52,101.52,"%D",11,0)
In order to satisfy the requirement that both the prescribing (CPRS) and 
"^DIC",101.52,101.52,"%D",12,0)
filling systems (Outpatient Pharmacy) create an archive, but to reduce the 
"^DIC",101.52,101.52,"%D",13,0)
need for additional storage space, both CPRS and Pharmacy will use the same 
"^DIC",101.52,101.52,"%D",14,0)
file. CPRS will create the entries when an order is signed or when a backdoor 
"^DIC",101.52,101.52,"%D",15,0)
order message is received from Pharmacy. Once Pharmacy verifies the data in 
"^DIC",101.52,101.52,"%D",16,0)
the Pharmacy system is an exact match for what CPRS stored, they will 
"^DIC",101.52,101.52,"%D",17,0)
subscribe to the entry in the archive file and will update the PRESCRIPTION 
"^DIC",101.52,101.52,"%D",18,0)
NUMBER (#1) field.
"^DIC",101.52,101.52,"%D",19,0)
 
"^DIC",101.52,101.52,"%D",20,0)
The file was defined in a different global name in order to handle the 
"^DIC",101.52,101.52,"%D",21,0)
volume set from the rest of the CPRS system (i.e., the ORDER file).
"^DIC",101.52,101.52,"%D",22,0)
It is important to note that to fully meet the DEA requirements, the fields 
"^DIC",101.52,101.52,"%D",23,0)
required by the DEA cannot be pointers. We must store the data completely. 
"^DIC",101.52,101.52,"%D",24,0)
The fields that are pointers are for our internal use, rather than for 
"^DIC",101.52,101.52,"%D",25,0)
the DEA purposes.
