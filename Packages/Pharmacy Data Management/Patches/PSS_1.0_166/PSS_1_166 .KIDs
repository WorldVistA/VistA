This is the Pharmacy Data Management patch (PSS*1*166) that provides
"BLD",8246,1,22,0)
the following enhancements and will be in the KIDS distribution PSS_1_166.
"BLD",8246,1,23,0)
 
"BLD",8246,1,24,0)
1. This patch modifies Integration Control Registration (ICR) #3737 by
"BLD",8246,1,25,0)
   adding the following two new Application Programming Interface (API):
"BLD",8246,1,26,0)
   a. The API $$DETOX^PSSOPKI will return a "1" (one) if the drug name 
"BLD",8246,1,27,0)
      contains "BUPREN", a detoxification drug or a "0" (zero) otherwise.
"BLD",8246,1,28,0)
 
"BLD",8246,1,29,0)
   b. The API $$OIDETOX^PSSOPKI is provided to CPRS to determine
"BLD",8246,1,30,0)
   whether an orderable item has an associated detoxification drug.
"BLD",8246,1,31,0)
 
"BLD",8246,1,32,0)
2. This patch modifies ICR #3784 - API $$IVDEA^PSSUTIL1 to return the 
"BLD",8246,1,33,0)
   specific CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE field (#19) code of the VA PRODUCT file
"BLD",8246,1,34,0)
   (#50.68) or the specific DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) code of the DRUG
"BLD",8246,1,35,0)
   file (#50) of the drugs tied to the Orderable Item.
"BLD",8246,1,36,0)
 
"BLD",8246,1,37,0)
3. Patch PSS*1*159 introduced an issue where the user was prevented from
"BLD",8246,1,38,0)
   up-arrowing (^) to quit out of the template in the Edit Orderable Items
"BLD",8246,1,39,0)
   [PSS EDIT ORDERABLE ITEMS] option. This patch resolves that issue by
"BLD",8246,1,40,0)
   allowing the user to up-arrow out of the template.
