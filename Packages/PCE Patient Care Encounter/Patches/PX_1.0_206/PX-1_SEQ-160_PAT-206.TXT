Description:
============

 WARNING! This patch cannot be re-installed without assistance from 
 Product Support.
  
 The Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture
 (VistA) Immunizations Enhancements (VIMM) 2.0 project modifies existing
 Skin Test files and adds additional files to enable VA to quickly and
 reliably document and exchange standardized skin test and immunization
 information on beneficiaries across services and departments.
 Additionally, modifications support VistA Evolution requirements. This
 provides a Veteran patient-centric vaccine record exchangeable with the
 external community. Clinicians will have access to a more complete medical
 history in the VistA electronic medical record resulting in improved
 health status as well as public health monitoring.
  
 The goals for the VIMM 2.0 project are to deliver an Initial Operating
 Capability comprised of standard, interoperable skin test and immunization
 data for exchange with external trading partners based on the
 modernization of the VistA Patient Care Encounter (PCE) package.
  
 This patch provides the following new features:
  
 1) The Skin Test records in the SKIN TEST (#9999999.28) file are 
 standardized to use consistent nomenclature for all VA facilities.
  
    During the post installation, records in the SKIN TEST file are
    modified and new Skin Test records are added to mirror entries from 
    a nationally standardized table.   
  
    A new field (CLASS) has been added to identify each record as NATIONAL
    or LOCAL. Only records with a CLASS of NATIONAL are selectable.   
    If a record is not the standard, the CLASS will be set to LOCAL and 
    the INACTIVE FLAG will be set to INACTIVE.
  
 2) The options, PXTT EDIT SKIN TEST and PXTT IN/ACTIVATE SKIN TEST, 
 have been placed out of order. Future updates to the SKIN TEST file
 will be maintained by the Master File Server.
  
 3) Bar codes from the Vaccine Information Statement Lookup table     
 (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/code-sets/vis-barcode-lookup-tab
 le.html) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been
 added to the VACCINE INFORMATION STATEMENT file (#920) to support use of
 scanning technology when recording which Vaccine Information Statement has
 been provided to a patient. The patch will also populate the Veterans 
 Health Administration Unique Identifiers (VUIDs) for this file.
  
 4) A spelling error in the short name for the IMMUNIZATION record,
 VARICELLA, is corrected from VARCELLA to VARICELLA.
  
 5) This patch populates VUID data fields for the following files:
    #920        VACCINE INFORMATION STATEMENT
    #920.1      IMMUNIZATION INFO SOURCE
    #920.2      IMM ADMINISTRATION ROUTE
    #920.3      IMM ADMINISTRATION SITE (BODY)
    #920.4      IMM CONTRAINDICATION REASONS
    #920.5      IMM REFUSAL REASONS
    #9999999.04 IMM MANUFACTURER
    #9999999.14 IMMUNIZATION
    #9999999.28 SKIN TEST
  
 6) The SKIN TEST file (#9999999.28) includes two new fields that are 
 Indian Health Service (IHS) fields and are added for backward 
 compatibility. These two fields are CODE (#.02) and CPT CODE (#.11).
  
 7)  Values in the MAX # IN SERIES field (#.05) in the IMMUNIZATION file 
 (#9999999.14) are standardized to be uniform across all VA facilities.   
 MAX # IN SERIES defines the permissible values for the SERIES property 
 when documenting an immunization in the V IMMUNIZATION file 
 (#9000010.11). Existing values at VA facilities will be replaced by the 
 standardized values, including removal of data where the standard does 
 not have a MAX # IN SERIES value.
  
 8) The Health Summary component for Skin Test has been modified to 
 display PRINT NAME as the name of the Skin Test in place of NAME if the 
 record is a National standard.

 Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 ------------------------------------- 
 Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this 
 patch is available.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
 ftp://download.vista.domain.ext/.
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as 
 follows:
  
  Albany         ftp.domain.ext  <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Hines          ftp.domain.ext   <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Salt Lake City ftp.domain.ext     <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 WARNING! This patch cannot be re-installed without assistance from
 Product Support.
  
 This patch will run a brief pre-installation process that will check for 
 duplicate entries in the SKIN TEST file (#9999999.28). If any duplicates 
 are detected, the installation will abort. Use the option, PXTT EDIT 
 SKIN TESTS, to rename duplicates and restart the installation of
 the patch.
  
 A post-installation process will standardize data in the SKIN TEST file
 (#9999999.28). Any errors that occur are displayed and an email with more
 detail is sent to the installer.
  
 If no errors occur during the conversion of the SKIN TEST file, a HEALTH 
 DATA INFORMATICS (HDI) routine is called to populate VUID data from the
 FORUM Master File Server.
  
 The post installation routine calls an HDI routine to request the      
 VUID data for the following files:
    #920.1      IMMUNIZATION INFO SOURCE
    #920.2      IMM ADMINISTRATION ROUTE
    #920.3      IMM ADMINISTRATION SITE (BODY)
    #920.4      IMM CONTRAINDICATIONS
    #920.5      IMM REFUSALS
    #9999999.04 IMM MANUFACTURER
    #9999999.14 IMMUNIZATION
    #9999999.28 SKIN TEST
  
 The routine, PXVP206, may be deleted after the patch is successfully
 installed.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 The following patches must be installed prior to installing this patch:
  1. XU*8*654    MFS PARAMETERS
  2. HDI*1*14    VIMM 2.0 Standardization
  3. PX*1*208    IMMUNIZATION SERIES, REACTION, & CONTRA DISAPPEARING
  
 Installation Instructions:

 activity, preferably with users off the system. Installation time is 
 expected to be approximately 10 minutes.

        is installed. It compares all components of this patch
        (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
  
    c.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
        backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
