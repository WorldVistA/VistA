Description:
============

 The Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture
 (VistA) Immunizations Enhancements (VIMM) 2.0 project, Increment 2, 
 builds upon the file structures and standardized data introduced by 
 Increment 1 by adding functional enhancements to the existing VistA 
 Patient Care Encounter (PCE) package.
  
 This patch provides the following new features:
  
 1) A new Clinical Reminders index will be created on the V IMMUNIZATION 
    file (#9000010.11). This additional index uses the immunization's CVX 
    code. The indexes are stored in the Clinical Reminders index global as:
      ^PXRMINDX(9000010.11,"CVX","IP",CVX CODE,DFN,DATE,DAS)
      ^PXRMINDX(9000010.11,"CVX","PI",DFN,CVX CODE,DATE,DAS)
    Also, the Clinical Reminders indexes on the V IMMUNIZATION file will be
    changed to use the EVENT DATE AND TIME field (#1201) (if populated) as
    the DATE instead of the Visit Date and Time. The Visit Date and Time 
    will be used as DATE only if the EVENT DATE AND TIME field is not
    populated.
  
 2) The following Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) have been added
    or modified:
    a) DATA2PCE^PXAPI (Modified) - Support for the following immunization 
       fields have been added to the INPUTROOT array parameter: VIS 
       Offered/Given To Patient, Remarks, and Ordering Provider
    b) ENCEVENT^PXKENC and GETENC^PXAPI (Modified) - The following V 
       IMMUNIZATION fields have been added to the returned ^TMP global 
       array: VIS Offered/Given To Patient, Remarks, and Other Diagnosis
    c) VIS^PXAPI (New) - Returns a Vaccine Information Statement entry
    d) IMMUN^PXRHS03 (Modified) - Two new optional parameters were added to
       control: 1) how the return global is sorted, and 2) to allow
       filtering based off Vaccine Group Name, IEN, or CVX. Also,
       additional data is returned in the return global.
  
 3) The PX SAVE DATA remote procedure call (RPC) has been modified to 
    provide support for CVX Code, Event Info Source IEN, Route IEN and HL7 
    Code, Admin Site IEN and HL7 code, Lot # IEN, Event Date/Time, 
    Ordering Provider, VIS, and Remarks.
  
 4) The security codes on the IMMUNIZATION file (#9999999.14) and SKIN TEST
    file (#9999999.28) will be updated as follows: AUDIT="@", DD="@",
    DEL="@", LAYGO="@", RD="", and WR="@".
  
 5) The PCE skin test documentation process is updated to include the 
    following:
    a) Test placement, reading and interpretation
    b) Code set mapping
    c) Diagnosis information entry and updates are restricted to users 
       with supervisor access.
    
 6) The PCE immunization documentation process is updated to include the 
    following:
    a) Lot number, ordering provider, dosage, route of administration, site
       of administration
    b) Post-administration reading and interpretation for immunizations 
       that require reading, such as smallpox.
    c) Diagnosis information entry and updates are restricted to users 
       with supervisor access.
    
 7) Immunization inventory management functionality is added by this patch.
    This functionality includes allowing authorized users to enter and 
    update information in the IMMUNIZATION LOT file (#9999999.41). This 
    functionality provides for displaying available immunization 
    inventory. Cross reference functionality decrements the number of doses
    unused when an immunization lot is assigned to a patient's immunization
    record.
  
 8) Values for the following fields in the V SKIN TEST file (#9000010.12) 
    are moved from existing fields to new fields by a post-install process.
    The old fields and their data are removed from the file after moving
    the data.
  
       From Field             To Field

     DIAGNOSIS 8 (#.15) --> DIAGNOSIS 8 (#808)
  
 9) When documenting an historical immunization, the user will now be able 
    to select inactive immunizations that are marked as Selectable For 
    Historic.

    Installation Guide 
  
 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 The pre-installation process removes seven MUMPS cross-references that 
 existed only in early versions of this patch.
  
 The post-installation process does the following:
 a) Tasks a job to rebuild the Clinical Reminder's V Immunization index.
    When installing the patch, the user will be prompted when this task
    should be queued (see installation instructions below). This should be
    queued to run during non-peak hours. It is very important that it is
    done during non-peak hours, as while the rebuild is taking place all
    evaluation, dialogs, reminder order checks, and anything using reminder
    evaluation will be suspended. When the index is completed building, an
    email gets sent to the user who installed the patch and to the mail
    group specified in the REMINDER MANAGEMENT MAILGROUP field (#3) of the
    CLINICAL REMINDER PARAMETERS file (#800).
  
 b) Moves diagnosis values from the existing diagnosis fields in the V SKIN
    TEST file (#9000010.12) to the new diagnosis fields, deletes the values
    in the existing fields and finally deletes the existing fields from the
    data dictionary as described above in the new features section.
  
 c) Tasks a process to split the V IMMUNIZATION dosage values stored in the
    existing DOSAGE field (#1312) into DOSE (#1312) and DOSE UNITS (#1313).
    If the existing value does not match the DD, it will be appended to the
    COMMENTS field (#81101).
  
 The routine PXVP210 may be deleted after the email is received that the
 index was rebuilt.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:

 N/A
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 This patch should be installed during a period of minimal system 
 activity, preferably with users off the system. Installation time is 
 expected to be approximately 10 minutes.
  
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
    Installation Menu. From this menu, you may elect to use the following
    options. When prompted for the INSTALL enter the patch # (PX*1.0*210):
  
    a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup message
       of any routines exported with this patch. It will not backup any
       other changes such as DD's or templates. 
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will allow
       you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is
       installed. It compares all components of this patch (routines,
       DD's, templates, etc.). 
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you to
       ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
       global.
    d. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view the
       components of the KIDS build.
  
 4. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
    choose the patch to install. Enter PX*1.0*210.
  
 5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
    Install? YES//', respond YES.
  
 6. When prompted 'Queue time to rebuild V Immunization Clinical Reminder
    index: ' Enter a queue date/time for rebuilding the Clinical Reminders
    index on the V IMMUNIZATION file. It should be queued to run during 
    non-peak hours. The date/time entered must fall within 7 days of the 
    patch installation date. If a value is not entered, the patch will be 
    queued to run at the end of patch installation. (See pre/post
    installation overview above).
  
 7. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//',
    respond NO.
  
 8. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? NO//', respond NO.
  
 Post-Installation Instructions
 ------------------------------
 1. When the Clinical Reminders index on the V IMMUNIZATION file is
    completed building, an email is sent to the user who installed the
    patch and to the mail group specified in the REMINDER MANAGEMENT
    MAILGROUP field (#3) of the CLINICAL REMINDER PARAMETERS file (#800).
    The routine PXVP210 may be deleted after the email is received that the
    index was rebuilt.
  
    a. If any entries couldn't be indexed, another MailMan message will be
       sent out with the list of entries and the reason they could not be
       indexed. Entries that were not indexed will never be found by any
       application that uses the index to find data. Each site should make
       a decision concerning what they want to do about non-indexed
       entries.
  
 2. Users authorized to manage immunization inventory should be assigned
    the PXV IMM INVENTORY MGR security key.
  
 3. The option PXVTASK-NIGHT should be tasked to run daily at 12:01 AM.
