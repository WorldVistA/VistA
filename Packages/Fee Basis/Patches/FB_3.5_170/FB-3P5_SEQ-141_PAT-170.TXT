 CA TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ===================
 1. I7066044FY16 - Update RBRVS for CY2016
   
    Problem:
    --------
    The RBRVS Fee Schedule needs to be updated for the Calendar Year 2016.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    This patch includes the data needed to calculate fee schedule amounts
    based on the RBRVS (also referred to as Medicare Physician Fee
    Schedule) for calendar year 2016. The RBRVS fee schedule for future
    calendar years will be issued by a patch as they become available. The
    RBRVS fee schedule data is contained in four existing files. These
    files are all stored in global "^FB". The four files are:
  
      FEE BASIS GEOGRAPHIC INDEX (#162.96) FILE
      FEE BASIS CPT RVU (#162.97) FILE
      FEE BASIS MODIFIER TABLE INDEX (#162.98) FILE
      FEE BASIS HCFA CONVERSION (#162.99) FILE
  
    The additional data added by this patch will increase the size of the
    FB global by approximately 5 MB.
  
 Installation of this patch will affect the menu options used to enter or edit
 payments for the Medical Fee program (Outpatient) and Ancillary Payments for 
 the Civil Hospital program.
  
 The calendar year 2016 RBRVS fee schedule will be used for payments that
 have a date of service on or after January 1, 2016.
  
 The RBRVS fee schedules for calendar years beginning 1999 through 2015
 will be retained in the VISTA database and will continue to be used for
 payments that have a date of service on or after September 1, 1999 and
 before January 1, 2016.
  
 The 2002 RBRVS fee schedule will be used for any payments entered prior to
 the installation of this patch that had a date of service on or before
 March 1, 2003.
  
 Existing payments are NOT modified by this patch. The fee schedule amount
 is only calculated when payments are entered or edited. The PLACE OF
 SERVICE (POS) code is used to determine if the facility or non-facility
 practice expense Relative Value Unit (RVU) should be used during RBRVS fee
 schedule calculations. The list of codes considered facility and 
 non-facility has not changed since 2011.  Here are the valid POS codes 
 that are in effect.
  
        Codes considered as facility setting -
        05,06,07,08,21,22,23,24,26,31,34,41,42,51,52,53,56,61
  
        Codes considered as non-facility setting -
        01,03,04,09,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,20,25,32,33,49,50,54,
        55,57,60,62,65,71,72,81,99
  
  The following four options are used to enter or edit payments for the
  Medical Fee (outpatient) program:
  
       Enter Payment                       [FBAA ENTER PAYMENT]
       Multiple Payment Entry              [FBAA MULTIPLE PAYMENT ENTRY]
       Reimbursement Payment Entry         [FBAA MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT]
       Edit Payment                        [FBAA EDIT PAYMENT]
  
  The following four options are used to enter or edit ancillary payments
  for the Civil Hospital program:
  
       Ancillary Contract Hosp/CNH Payment  [FBCH ANCILLARY PAYMENT]
       Multiple Ancillary Payments          [FBCH MULTIPLE PAYMENTS]
       Patient Reimbursement for Ancillary  [FBCH ANCILLARY REIMBURSEMENT]
       Services
       Edit Ancillary Payment               [FBCH EDIT ANCILLARY PAYMENT]
  
  The following option is used to calculate a fee schedule amount
  without having to enter a payment:
  
       Calculate Payment Amount             [FBAA FEE SCHEDULE RATE]
